<td>Nine instances of biometrics in the conversation. The conversation is centered around whether biometrics should be removed. rhiaro says, &quot;Personal preference to remove biometrics examples from the spec. This is too dystopian, and I don&#39;t think we should be encouraging it even if it&#39;s technically possible. It&#39;s also dancing close to the PII and bound-forever problems (even though the example refers to an endpoint, rather than biometric data in the DID doc). I&#39;ve replaced the example with something less specific about credentials, but also happy to see a better more specific example suggested instead.&quot; Peacekeeper responds, :&quot;Hmm I agree in general with not encouraging (or actively discouraging) things that can be dangerous and misused. But I also believe it&#39;s important to not lose the idea that verification methods can be very flexible and not limited to cryptographic keys.<br/>I think there will be non-dystophian use cases where for some reason you are unable to use cryptographic keys, but you still want a decentralized identifier and a way to prove control over it (including by using biometrics).<br/>So I&#39;d be fine with removing the example, as long as it&#39;s still possible to do it.&quot; In the end msporny comments, &quot;Editorial, changes requested and made, multiple positive reviews, no objections, merging.&quot;</td>

Peacekeeper saying, &quot;Agree with removing &quot;pseudonymous biometrics&quot; here. If we wanted to say anything about biometrics, we should have done that elsewhere, not in the terminology section.&quot;</td>
