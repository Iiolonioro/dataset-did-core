title: Empirical Community Journalism about Decentralized Identifiers
---

Welcome to the DID-Core Dataset, or DCD.  This is a community effort to
provide an empirical and historical accounting of the evolution of DIDs
and their relation to descendant and related technologies.

DID Methods are analyzed separately in the DID Method Dataset or DMD.

The DCD is an analysis of the W3C DID-Core specification as it has evolved
since inception in 2016.  This document *strictly* tracks the
[W3C DID-Core Git Hub Repository](https://github.com/w3c/did-core),
which is the root of authority.  All statements which do not provenance back
to this specification are opinionated to some degree.

This repository structures opinion about the did-core specification
and places highest accolades on provenance which tracks back to a commit
within the did-core repository history.  It is not the intention of this
repository to establish a record of authority above and beyond the
narrative created by the empirical community journalism
[code of engagement](#code-of-engagement).

Possession of a copy of this repository adopts the terms and conditions
as set forth above.  This is an aggressive contract of adhesion and all
rights remain with the repository.


## Why is this needed

What is has meant to 'have a did' or what role a did should play in any
sort of identity, credential, or digital trust architecture has been difficult
to pin down.  Exhaustive and unproductive fights between the pro linked data
and anti linked data factions resulted in convolutions and complexities
that have spurned adoption.  Arguments about 'where the decentralization"
is have hampered the utility of the identifiers to provide a uniform
field of resolution and enhance the attraction of verifiable credentials.

## Invitation

## How

### Code of Engagement

### Emperical Commmunity Journalism

The DCD aspires to be a vehicle for empirically driven community driven
journalism, where journalism itself is recognized as ranging between
highly opinionated, or editorial or effortfully objective attempts to
explain and capture complication and sometimes emotional topics in clear
form suitable for digestion by a wide audience.

## Background

### About DIDs and the History of DIDs

Other documents for understanding the DID Core specification include:

* [W3C DID-Core Latest Published Version](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)
* [W3C DID-Core Latest Editors Draft](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/)
* [W3C DID-Core Git Hub Repository](https://github.com/w3c/did-core)
* [W3C CCG did-spec Git Hub Repository](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec)

which spans the time during which the DID spec was part of a W3C Community Group
as well as after the official formation of a W3C Working Group.
