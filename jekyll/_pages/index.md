title: Empirical Community Journalism about Decentralized Identifiers
---

Welcome to the DID-Core Dataset, or DCD.  The DCD is a community artifact
providing an historical account of the origina and evolution of DIDs
and their descendant and related technologies.

DID Methods are analyzed separately in the DID Method Dataset or DMD.

The DCD is an analysis of the W3C DID-Core specification as it has evolved
since inception in 2016.  This document primarily tracks the
[W3C DID-Core Git Hub Repository](https://github.com/w3c/did-core),
which is the root of authority.  All statements which do not provenance back to
this specification are nonjudgementally recognized as opinionated to some
degree.

This repository structures this opinion about the did-core specification
and places highest accolades on provenance which tracks back to a verified
commit within the did-core repository history.  It is not the intention of this
repository to establish a record of authority above and beyond the
narrative created by the empirical community journalism
[code of engagement](#code-of-engagement).

Possession of a copy of this repository adopts the terms and conditions
as set forth above.  This is an aggressive contract of adhesion and all
rights remain with the repository.


## Why is this needed

DIDs have a meandering history as an idea that grew out of discussions about
verifiable credentials and internet identity and has become a mainstay of
the internet community working on a formal technical recommendation via the
[W3C's DID Working Group]().

This organic process has lead to a rather odd shaped duck in a pond other
duck shaped identity anchor systems - all the classic, decentralized, and
hybrid reality that defines the context in which DIDs find themselves.

Despite tremendous progress on the DID core specification, and the tireless
and dedicated krewe responsible for this hot mess, we still find questions
such as these difficult to answer:

* So what does it mean to "Have a DID?""
* Are DIDs Public?  and do they contain PII?
* Are dids more for Purls or for proof
* What are examples of service endpoints?
* What is my 'authentication' relationship with a DID
* Are biometrics allowed?
* Are they extensible?
* Can they be related to digital payloads?
* Why are there so many methods and how do I choose?
* What is the rate of adoption of dids?
* Do DIDs ineroperate with other identifier systems?
* How do DIDs relate to CAICT's infrastructure or the India Stack?
* Are DIDs interoperable with X.509?
* Does anything require DIDs?

With confusion about core and fundamental questions such as these left without
simple, clear, and obvious answers.

## Invitation

Participation is invited, subject to the
[Code of Engagement](#code-of-engagement).  The action of having a verified
and signed `did:git` pull request merged into main represents that acceptance
of the Code of Engagement, which defines means and mechanisms for discussion
and further modification of the Code of Engagement.

## How

### Code of Engagement

The Code of Engagement is a contract of inclusion that is modeled after the
ToIP infrastructure.  It consists of a Master Document and a suite of
Controlled Documents, which are defined within this repository.  We
use [did:git](#role-of-did:git) verified commits to identify the official
record for legislative purposes.  All non-verified commits are to be excluded
from all official representations.

### Emperical Commmunity Journalism

The DCD aspires to be a vehicle for empirically driven community driven
journalism, where journalism itself is recognized as ranging between
highly opinionated, or editorial or effortfully objective attempts to
explain and capture complication and sometimes emotional topics in clear
form suitable for digestion by a wide audience.

### Role of did:git

*incorporate that doc from the google drive*

### Relationship to ToIP

We use ToIP as the model.
We seek and anticipate convergence and welcome corporate support to do so.


## Background

### About DIDs and the History of DIDs

* DID Primer
* IIW, RWOT, W3C, Etc.
* chapters, key documents

Other documents for understanding the DID Core specification include:

* [W3C DID-Core Latest Published Version](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)
* [W3C DID-Core Latest Editors Draft](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/)
* [W3C DID-Core Git Hub Repository](https://github.com/w3c/did-core)
* [W3C CCG did-spec Git Hub Repository](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec)

which spans the time during which the DID spec was part of a W3C Community Group
as well as after the official formation of a W3C Working Group.
