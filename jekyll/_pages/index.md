title: DID Core Specification Community Journalism
---

Welcome to the DID-Core Dataset, or DCD.  DID Methods are not covered here, rather, those are analyzed separately  in the DID Method Dataset or DMD.

The DCD is an analysis of the W3C DID-Core specification as it has evolved
since inception in 2016 to the current day.

Key documents for understanding the DID Core specification include:

* [W3C DID-Core Latest Published Version](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)
* [W3C DID-Core Latest Editors Draft](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/)
* [W3C DID-Core Git Hub Repository](https://github.com/w3c/did-core)
* [W3C CCG did-spec Git Hub Repository](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec)

which spans the time during which the DID spec was part of a W3C Community Group
as well as after the official formation of a W3C Working Group.

## Why is this needed

What is has meant to 'have a did' or what role a did should play in any
sort of identity, credential, or digital trust architecture has been difficult
to pin down.  Exhaustive and unproductive fights between the pro linked data
and anti linked data factions resulted in convolutions and complexities
that have spurned adoption.  Arguments about 'where the decentralization"
is have hampered the utility of the identifiers to provide a uniform
field of resolution and enhance the attraction of verifiable credentials.

## Emperical Commmunity Journalism

The DCD aspires to be a vehicle for empirically driven community driven
journalism, where journalism itself is recognized as ranging between
highly opinionated, or editorial or effortfully objective attempts to
explain and capture complication and sometimes emotional topics in clear
form suitable for digestion by a wide audience.
