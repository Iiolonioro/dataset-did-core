   "Issue Summary": "Nine instances of biometrics in the conversation. The conversation is centered around whether biometrics should be removed. rhiaro says, \"Personal preference to remove biometrics examples from the spec. This is too dystopian, and I don't think we should be encouraging it even if it's technically possible. It's also dancing close to the PII and bound-forever problems (even though the example refers to an endpoint, rather than biometric data in the DID doc). I've replaced the example with something less specific about credentials, but also happy to see a better more specific example suggested instead.\" Peacekeeper responds, :\"Hmm I agree in general with not encouraging (or actively discouraging) things that can be dangerous and misused. But I also believe it's important to not lose the idea that verification methods can be very flexible and not limited to cryptographic keys.\nI think there will be non-dystophian use cases where for some reason you are unable to use cryptographic keys, but you still want a decentralized identifier and a way to prove control over it (including by using biometrics).\nSo I'd be fine with removing the example, as long as it's still possible to do it.\" In the end msporny comments, \"Editorial, changes requested and made, multiple positive reviews, no objections, merging.\""
