DIDs (decentralized identifiers) are a new type of identifier intended
for verifiable digital identity that is "self-sovereign", i.e., fully
under the control of the identity owner and not dependent on a
centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs
resolve to DDOs (DID descriptor objects)—simple JSON documents that
contain all the metadata needed to prove ownership and control of a DID.
Specifically, a DDO contains a set of key descriptions, which are
machine-readable descriptions of the identity owner’s public keys, and a
set of service endpoints, which are resource pointers necessary to
initiate trusted interactions with the identity owner. Each DID uses a
specific DID method, defined in a separate DID method specification, to
define how the DID is registered, resolved, updated, and revoked on a
specific distributed ledger or network.
