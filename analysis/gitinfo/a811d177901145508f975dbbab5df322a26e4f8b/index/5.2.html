Specific DID Method Schemes

A DID method specification MUST define exactly one specific DID scheme
identified by exactly one method name (the method rule in Section
).
Since DIDs are intended for decentralized identity infrastructure, it is
NOT RECOMMENDED to establish a registry of unique DID method names.
Rather the uniqueness of DID method names should be established via
human consensus, i.e., a specific DID scheme MUST use a method name that
is unique among all DID method names known to the specification authors
at the time of publication.


A list of known DID method names is included in
Appendix .


Since the method name is part of the DID, it SHOULD be as short as
practical. A method name of five characters or less is RECOMMENDED. The
method name MAY reflect the name of the distributed ledger or network to
which the DID method specification applies.


The DID method specification for the specific DID scheme MUST specify
how to generate the specific-idstring component of a DID. The
specific-idstring value MUST be able to be generated without the use of
a centralized registry service. The specific-idstring value SHOULD be
globally unique by itself. The fully qualified DID as defined by the did
rule in Section  MUST be globally unique.


If needed, a specific DID scheme MAY define multiple specific
specific-idstring formats. It is RECOMMENDED that a specific DID scheme
define as few specific-idstring formats as possible.
