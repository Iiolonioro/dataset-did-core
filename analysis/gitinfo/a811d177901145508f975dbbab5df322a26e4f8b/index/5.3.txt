DID Paths

A generic DID path (the did-path rule in Section
) is identical to a
URI path and MUST conform to the ABNF of the path-rootless ABNF rule in
[[RFC3986]]. A DID path
SHOULD be used to address resources available via a DID service
endpoint. See Section .


A specific DID scheme MAY specify ABNF rules for DID paths that are more
restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
