Time Locks and DDO Recovery Section 9.7 mentions one possible clever use of time locks to recover control of a DID after a key compromise. The technique relies on an ability to override the most recent update to a DDO with Proof of Control applied by an earlier version of the DDO in order to defeat the attacker. This protection depends on adding a time lock (see Bitcoin BIP 65) to protect part of the transaction chain, enabling a Proof of Control block to be used to recover control. We plan to add support for time locks in a future version of this specification.
