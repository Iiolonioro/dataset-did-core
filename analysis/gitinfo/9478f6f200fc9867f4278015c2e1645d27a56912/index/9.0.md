DID Operations To enable the full functionality of DIDs and DDOs on a particular distributed ledger or network (called the target system), a DID method specification MUST specify how each of the following CRUD operations is performed by a client. Each operation MUST be specified to the level of detail necessary to build and test interoperable client implementations with the target system. Note that, due to the specified contents of DDOs, these operations can effectively be used to perform all the operations required of a CKMS (cryptographic key management system), e.g.: Key registration Key replacement Key rotation Key recovery Key expiration Create The DID method specification MUST specify how a client creates a DID record—the combination of a DID and its associated DDO—on the target system, including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of ownership. Read/Verify The DID method specification MUST specify how a client uses a DID to request a DDO from the target system, including how the client can verify the authenticity of the response. Update The DID method specification MUST specify how a client can update a DID record on the target system, including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of control. Delete/Revoke Although a core feature of distributed ledgers is immutability, the DID method specification MUST specify how a client can revoke a DID record on the target system, including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of revocation.
