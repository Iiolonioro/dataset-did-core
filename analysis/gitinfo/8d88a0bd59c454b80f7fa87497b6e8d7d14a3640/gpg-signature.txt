 Following is an example of a DID Document that describes the DID above. This
-example assumes that the entity—the entity that controls the
-private keys for this identity—is authoritative for the DID Document. See section
-1.3.2 for an example of a DID Document created by a delegate. For the authoritative
-JSON-LD context definition, see Appendix B (the URL for the @context
-property below is just for illustration).
