9.2.1 Proving Ownership of a DID and DID Document




      By itself, a verified signature on self-signed DID Document does not prove ownership of a DID. It only proves the following:





The DID Document has not been tampered with since it was registered.
  

The owner of the DID Document controlled the private key used for the
signature at the time the signature was generated.
  




      Proving ownership of a DID, i.e., the binding between the DID and the DID Document that describes it, requires a two step process:





Resolving the DID to a DID Document according to its DID method
specification.
  

Verifying that the id property of the resulting DID Document matches the DID
that was resolved.
  




      It should be noted that this process proves ownership of a DID and DID Document regardless of whether the DID Document is signed.





9.2.2 Proving Ownership of a Public Key




      There are two methods for proving ownership of the private key corresponding to a public key description in the DID Document: static and dynamic.


      The static method is to sign the DID Document with the private key. This proves ownership of the private key at a time no later than the DID Document was registered.


      If the DID Document is not signed, ownership of a public key described in the DID Document may still be proven dynamically as follows:





Send a challenge message containing a public key description from
the DID Document and a nonce to an appropriate service endpoint described in the
DID Document.
  

Verify the signature of the response message against the public key
description.
  




9.2.3 Identity Owner Authentication and Verifiable Claims




      A DID and DID Document do not inherently carry any
        PII
       (personally-identifiable information). The process of binding a DID to the real-world owner of an identity using claims about the owner is out of scope for this specification. However this topic is the focus of the
        verifiable claims
       standardization work at the W3C (where the term "DID" originated).
