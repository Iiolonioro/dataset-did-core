Service Endpoint References (Optional)


    
      In addition to publication of cryptographic key material, the other primary purpose of DID records is to enable discovery of service endpoints for the identity owner. A service endpoint may represent any type of service the identity owner wishes to advertise, including decentralized identity management services for further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction.

    
      The rules for service endpoints are:




A DDO MAY have exactly one property representing service endpoints.
  
The key for this property MUST be service.
  
The value of this key MUST be a nested JSON object.
  
In this nested JSON object, each property MUST have a key
representing the name of a service established in either the generic
JSON-LD context (see Appendix B) or a method-specific context
definition.
  
The value of this key MUST be a valid URI conforming to RFC 3986  and normalized
according to the rules in section 6 of RFC 3986  and to any
normalization rules in its applicable URI scheme specification.
  



    
      Example:





      {
      "service": {
            "openid": "https://openid.example.com/456",
            "xdi": "https://xdi.example.com/123"
        }
      }




    
      See sections 9.1 and 9.3 for further security considerations regarding authentication service endpoints.
