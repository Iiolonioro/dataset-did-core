DID Normalization

For the broadest interoperability, DID normalization should be as simple
and universal as possible. Therefore:


The did: scheme name MUST be lowercase.
  
The method name MUST be lowercase.
  
Case sensitivity and normalization of the value of the
specific-idstring rule in section 5.1 MUST be defined by the governing
DID method specification.
