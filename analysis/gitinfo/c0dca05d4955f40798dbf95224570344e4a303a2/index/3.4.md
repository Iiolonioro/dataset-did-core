The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers DIDs achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central registration authority. This comes, however, at the cost of human memorability. The algorithms capable of generating globally unique identifiers automatically produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This demonstrates the axiom about identifiers known as Zooko’s Triangle : "human-meaningful, decentralized, secure—pick any two". There are of course many use cases where it is desirable to discover a DID when starting from a human-friendly identifier—a natural language name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a DID owner such as a mobile telephone number, email address, Twitter handle, or blog URL. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to DIDs (and doing so in a way that can be verified and trusted) is out-of-scope for this specification. Solutions to this problem (and there are many) should be defined in separate specifications that reference this specification. It is strongly recommended that such specifications carefully consider: (a) the numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly identifier for a target entity, and (b) the privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.
