Delegates The way that Delegates are handled is changing. The feature is still supported, but via the `authorizationCapability` field rather than the more specialized `guardian` field. A delegate is an entity, such as a parent or aid organization, that creates and maintains a DID Document for a dependent who is not in a position to hold or control authentication credentials (e.g., cryptographic keys). The rules for a delegate are: A DID Document that includes an authenticationCredential field (section 6.4) MAY list one or more delegates via the authorizationCapability field. A DID Document that does not include an authenticationCredential MUST have a delegate. The authorizationCapability field must contain a capability for the delegate that includes UpdateDidDocument as the capability, the DID of the delegate as the entity, and MAY include a more specific set of authenticationCredentials that the delegate MAY use to authenticate when updating the DID Document. The delegate DID MUST resolve to a DID Document that has a authenticationCredential property containing at least one value i.e., the delegate relationships must not be nested. Example: { "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1", "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi", "authorizationCapability": [{ // this entity is a delegate and may update any field in this // DID Document using any authentication mechanism understood // by the ledger "permission": "UpdateDidDocument", "entity": "did:example:zxyvwtrkpn987654321" }], "credentialRepositoryService": "https://vc.example.com/abcdef", "authenticationCredential": [{ // this biometric can be used to authenticate as DID ...fghi "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi/biometric/1", "type": "PseudonymousBiometricTemplate2017", "owner": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi", "biometricService": "https://example.com/authenticate" "biometricTemplateShard": "Mjk4MzQyO...5Mzg0MDI5Mwo=" }] }
