Authentication

Authentication is the mechanism by which an entity can
cryptographically prove that they are associated with a DID and DID
Description. See section 9.2. Note that Authentication is separate from
Authorization because an entity may wish to enable other entities
to update the DID Document
(for example, to assist with key recovery as discussed in section 6.5)
without enabling them to prove ownership (and thus be able to impersonate
the entity).


The rules for Authentication are:



A DID Document MAY include a authenticationCredential
property.
  

The value of the authenticationCredential property should be an
array of proof mechanisms.
  

Each proof mechanism must include id,
type, and owner properties.
  

Each proof mechanism MAY be a key description of a valid public key or
verification key. A list of standard key descriptions is included in
Appendix .
A new key description MAY also be defined by a DID method specification.
  


Example:


{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "authenticationCredential": [{
    // this biometric can be used to authenticate as DID ...fghi
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi/biometric/1",
    "type": "PseudonymousBiometricTemplate2017",
    "owner": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "biometricService": "https://example.com/authenticate"
    "biometricTemplateShard": "Mjk4MzQyO...5Mzg0MDI5Mwo="
  }, {
    // this key can be used to authenticate as DID ...fghi
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
    "type": "RsaCryptographicKey",
    "owner": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
  }]
}


Caching and expiration of the keys in a DID Document
authenticationCredential property is entirely the
responsibility of DID resolvers and other clients. See Section
.
