The Generic DID Scheme

The generic DID scheme is a URI scheme conformant with RFC 3986 . It consists of a
DID followed by an optional path and/or fragment. The term DID refers
only to the identifier conforming to the did rule in the ABNF below;
when used alone, it does not include a path or fragment. A DID that may
optionally include a path and/or fragment is called a DID reference.


Following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in RFC 5234 (which defines ALPHA
as upper or lowercase A-Z).


  did-reference      = did [ "/" did-path ] [ "#" did-fragment ]
  did                = "did:" method ":" specific-idstring
  method             = 1*methodchar
  methodchar         = %x61-7A / DIGIT
  specific-idstring  = idstring *( ":" idstring )
  idstring           = 1*idchar
  idchar             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-"


See sections 5.3 and 5.4 for the ABNF rules defining DID paths and
fragments.
