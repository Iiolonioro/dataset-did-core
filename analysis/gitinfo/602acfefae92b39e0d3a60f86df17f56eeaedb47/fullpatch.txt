 <h2>DID Document Correlation Risks</h2>
 
 <p>
-
-
       The anti-correlation protections of pseudonymous DIDs are easily defeated if the data in the corresponding DID Documents can be correlated. For example, using same public key descriptions or bespoke service endpoints in multiple DID Documents can provide as much correlation information as using the same DID. Therefore the DID Document for a pseudonymous DID SHOULD also use pairwise-unique public keys and pairwise-unique service endpoints.
