Context

JSON objects in JSON-LD format must include a JSON-LD context statement.
The rules for this statement are:



A DID Document MUST have exactly one top-level context statement.
  

This statement MUST be the first line in the JSON object. (This is
not strictly necessary under JSON-LD but required for DID Documents.)
  

The key for this property MUST be @context.
  

The value of this key MUST be the URL for the generic DID context as
specified in Appendix B.
  


Example (using an example URL):


{
  "@context": "https://example.org/did/v1"
}


DID method specifications MAY define their own JSON-LD contexts. However
it is NOT RECOMMENDED to define a new context unless necessary to
properly implement the method. Method-specific contexts MUST NOT
override the terms defined in the generic DID context listed in Appendix
B.
