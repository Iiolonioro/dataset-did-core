DID Documents

If a DID is the index key in a key-value pair, then the DID Document is the
value to which the index key points. The combination of a DID and its
associated DID Document forms the root identity record for a decentralized
identity.


A DID Document MUST be a single JSON object conforming to RFC 7159. For purposes of
this version of the DID specification, the format of this JSON object is
specified in JSON-LD, a format for
mapping JSON data into the RDF semantic graph model as defined by the
  W3C JSON-LD 1.0
specification. Future versions of this specification MAY specify
other semantic graph formats for a DID Document such as JXD (JSON XDI Data), a
serialization format for the 
XDI graph model.


The following sections define the properties of this JSON object,
including whether these properties are required or optional.


Context

JSON objects in JSON-LD format must include a JSON-LD context statement.
The rules for this statement are:



A DID Document MUST have exactly one top-level context statement.
  

This statement MUST be the first line in the JSON object. (This is
not strictly necessary under JSON-LD but required for DID Documents.)
  

The key for this property MUST be @context.
  

The value of this key MUST be the URL for the generic DID context as
specified in Appendix B.
  


Example (using an example URL):


{
  "@context": "https://example.org/did/v1"
}


DID method specifications MAY define their own JSON-LD contexts. However
it is NOT RECOMMENDED to define a new context unless necessary to
properly implement the method. Method-specific contexts MUST NOT
override the terms defined in the generic DID context listed in Appendix
B.



Primary DID

The primary DID is the primary index key for the DID Document, i.e., it is DID
described by DID Document. The rules for a primary DID are:



A DID Document MUST have exactly one primary DID.
  

The key for this property MUST be id.
  

The value of this key MUST be a valid DID.
  

When this DID Document is registered with the target distributed ledger or
network, the registered DID MUST match this primary DID value.
  


Example:


{
  "id": "did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp"
}



Delegates

The way that Delegates are handled is changing. The feature is still supported,
but via the `authorizationCapability` field rather than the more specialized
`guardian` field.


A delegate is an entity, such as a parent or aid organization, that creates and
maintains a DID Document for a dependent who is not in a position to hold
or control authentication credentials (e.g., cryptographic keys).


The rules for a delegate are:



A DID Document that includes an
authenticationCredential field (section 6.4) MAY list one or
more delegates via the authorizationCapability field.
  

A DID Document that does not include an
authenticationCredential MUST have a delegate.
  

The authorizationCapability field must contain a capability for the
delegate that includes UpdateDidDocument as the capability,
the DID of the delegate as the entity, and MAY include a
more specific set of authenticationCredentials that the
delegate MAY use to authenticate when updating the DID Document.
  

The delegate DID MUST resolve to a DID Document that has a
authenticationCredential property containing at least one value
i.e., the delegate relationships must not be nested.
  


Example:


{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "authorizationCapability": [{
    // this entity is a delegate and may update any field in this
    // DID Document using any authentication mechanism understood
    // by the ledger
    "permission": "UpdateDidDocument",
    "entity": "did:example:zxyvwtrkpn987654321"
  }],
  "credentialRepositoryService": "https://vc.example.com/abcdef",
  "authenticationCredential": [{
    // this biometric can be used to authenticate as DID ...fghi
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi/biometric/1",
    "type": "PseudonymousBiometricTemplate2017",
    "owner": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "biometricService": "https://example.com/authenticate"
    "biometricTemplateShard": "Mjk4MzQyO...5Mzg0MDI5Mwo="
  }]
}



Authentication

Authentication is the mechanism by which an entity can
cryptographically prove that they are associated with a DID and DID
Description. See section 9.2. Note that Authentication is separate from
Authorization because an entity may wish to enable other entities
to update the DID Document
(for example, to assist with key recovery as discussed in section 6.5)
without enabling them to prove ownership (and thus be able to impersonate
the entity).


The rules for Authentication are:



A DID Document MAY include a authenticationCredential
property.
  

The value of the authenticationCredential property should be an
array of proof mechanisms.
  

Each proof mechanism must include id,
type, and owner properties.
  

Each proof mechanism MAY be a key description of a valid public key or
verification key. A list of standard key descriptions is included in
Appendix C. A new key description MAY also be defined by a DID method
specification.
  


Example:


{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "authenticationCredential": [{
    // this biometric can be used to authenticate as DID ...fghi
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi/biometric/1",
    "type": "PseudonymousBiometricTemplate2017",
    "owner": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "biometricService": "https://example.com/authenticate"
    "biometricTemplateShard": "Mjk4MzQyO...5Mzg0MDI5Mwo="
  }, {
    // this key can be used to authenticate as DID ...fghi
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
    "type": "RsaCryptographicKey",
    "owner": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
  }]
}


Caching and expiration of the keys in a DID Document
authenticationCredential property is entirely the
responsibility of DID resolvers and other clients. See Section
.



Authorization

Discussions at Rebooting the Web of Trust 5 resulted in consensus to
remove the authorizationCapability field as it is unclear whether
all ledgers will find the field useful. The field will most likely be moved
into a DID Method specification or a separate DID Ledger Capabilities
document. Authorization will most likely be a DID Method-specific
definition.


Authorization is the mechanism by which an entity may give itself
or other entities permission to update the DID Document—for example to assist with
key recovery. Note that Authorization is separate from Authentication
as explained in section 6.4. This is particularly important for key recovery
in the case of key loss, when the entity no longer has access to their
keys, or key compromise, where the owner’s trusted third parties need to
override malicious activity by an attacker. See section 9.


Because the access control logic in the Authorization block must be
implemented by the target distributed ledger or network, a DID method
specification MUST include its own Authorization rules and processing
logic. It is RECOMMENDED that all DID method specifications support the
generic Authorization rules specified in this section. A DID method
specification MAY add its own method-specific Authorization rules.


  The generic Authorization rules are:



A DID Document MAY have exactly one property named
authorizationCapability representing authorization information associated
with the DID Document.
  

The value of this property SHOULD be an array.
  

The values of this array MUST be defined in a DID method
specification and SHOULD follow a capabilities-based security model.
  

Updating the DID Document requires that the proof mechanism includes
the capability property and the
UpdateDidDocument value.
  

If an authorization rule does not specify a specific proof mechanism
(such as a public key ID), then an update proof verified with any
credential in the authenticationCredential property of the
DID Document dereferenced from that DID MUST be considered valid for
the proof mechanism.
  


6.5.1 Enabling Multiple Entities to Update the DID Document


To assert that any single member of a group of other DID owners has
permission to update the DID Document, the authorizationCapability
property array MAY contain multiple JSON objects:


{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:215cb1dc-1f44-4695-a07f-97649cad9938",
  "authorizationCapability": [{
    // this entity may update any field in this DID Document using any
    // authentication mechanism understood by the ledger
    "permission": "UpdateDidDocument",
    "entity": "did:example:z9f823hdf783h78fh2378"
  }, {
    // this entity may update the authenticationCredential field in this
    // DID Document as long as they authenticate with RsaSignature2017
    "permission": "UpdateDidDocument",
    "entity": "did:example:abvd73h285jf73hd73",
    "field": ["authenticationCredential"],
    "permittedProofType": [{
      "proofType": "RsaSignature2017"
    }]
  }]
}


If at least one update signature from a DID in this array is verified, it
MUST be considered valid for Authorization.


6.5.2 Requiring Multiple Proofs


To assert that a set of members of a group of other DID owners must act
together to update the DID Document, the authorizationCapability
property array MAY contain a single JSON object:


{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:215cb1dc-1f44-4695-a07f-97649cad9938",
  "authorizationCapability": [{
    // anyone may update the authenticationCredential and writeAuthorization
    // fields as long as they provide a specific multi-signature proof
    "permission": "UpdateDidDocument",
    "field": ["authenticationCredential", "writeAuthorization"],
    "permittedProofType": [{
      "proofType": "RsaSignature2017",
      "minimumSignatures": 3,
      "authenticationCredential": [{
        "id": "did:example:304ebc3e-7997-4bf4-a915-dd87e8455941#keys-123",
        "type": "RsaCryptographicKey",
        "owner": "did:example:304ebc3e-7997-4bf4-a915-dd87e8455941",
        "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:0f22346a-a360-4f3e-9b42-3366e348e941/keys/foo",
        "type": "RsaCryptographicKey",
        "owner": "did:example:0f22346a-a360-4f3e-9b42-3366e348e941",
        "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:a8d00377-e9f1-44df-a1b9-55072e13262a/keys/abc",
        "type": "RsaCryptographicKey",
        "owner": "did:example:a8d00377-e9f1-44df-a1b9-55072e13262a",
        "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
      }]
    }]
  }]
}



Service Endpoints

In addition to publication of authentication and authorization mechanisms,
the other primary purpose of a DID Document is to enable discovery of
service endpoints for the entity. A service endpoint may represent
any type of service the entity wishes to advertise, including
decentralized identity management services for further discovery,
authentication, authorization, or interaction.

      The rules for service endpoints are:




A DID Document MAY have multiple properties representing service endpoints.
  

The service endpoint protocol SHOULD be published in an open standard
specification.
  

The value of the service endpoint MUST be a valid URI conforming to RFC 3986 and normalized
according to the rules in section 6 of RFC 3986 and to any
normalization rules in its applicable URI scheme specification or a JSON-LD
object.
  




      Example:




{
  "credentialRepositoryService": "https://repository.example.com/123",
  "socialWebInboxService": {
    "id": "https://social.example.com/83hfh37dj",
    "description": "My public social inbox",
    "spamCost": {
      "amount": "0.50",
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  }
}




      See sections 9.1 and 9.3 for further security considerations regarding authentication service endpoints.






Created (Optional)



      Standard metadata for identity records includes a timestamp of the original creation. The rules for including a creation timestamp are:





A DID Document MUST have zero or one property representing a creation
timestamp. It is RECOMMENDED to include this property.
  

The key for this property MUST be created.
  

The value of this key MUST be a valid XML datetime value as defined
in section 3.3.7 of W3C
XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) 1.1 Part 2: Datatypes.
  

This datetime value MUST be normalized to UTC 00:00 as indicated by
the trailing "Z".
  

Method specifications that rely on DLTs SHOULD require time values
that are after the known "median
time past" (defined in Bitcoin BIP 113), when the DLT supports such
a notion.
  




      Example:





      {
      "created": "2002-10-10T17:00:00Z"
      }






Updated (Optional)



      Standard metadata for identity records includes a timestamp of the most recent change. The rules for including a updated timestamp are:





A DID Document MUST have zero or one property representing an updated
timestamp. It is RECOMMENDED to include this property.
  

The key for this property MUST be updated.
  

The value of this key MUST follow the formatting rules (3, 4, 5)
from section 6.7.
  




      Example:





      {
      "updated": "2016-10-17T02:41:00Z"
      }






Signature (Optional)



      A signature on a DID Document is cryptographic proof of the integrity of the DID Document according to either:





The entity as defined in section 6.4, or if not present:
  

The delegate as defined in section 6.3.
  




      This signature is NOT proof of the binding between a DID and a DID Document. See section 9.2.


      The rules for a signature are:





A DID Document MAY have exactly one property representing a signature.
  

The key for this property MUST be signature.
  

The value of this key MUST be a valid JSON-LD signature as defined
by Linked Data
Signatures.
  




      Example:





      {
      "signature": {
            "type": "LinkedDataSignature2015",
            "created": "2016-02-08T16:02:20Z",
            "creator": "did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1ja#keys-1",
            "signatureValue": "QNB13Y7Q9...1tzjn4w=="
        }




      }
