Equivalence Including an equivalence property, such as equivID, in DID Documents whose value is an array of DIDs would allow entitys to assert two or more DIDs that represent the same entity. This capability has numerous uses, including supporting migration between ledgers and providing forward compatibility of existing DIDs to future DLTs. In theory, equivalent DIDs should have the same identity rights, allowing verifiable claims made against one DID to apply to equivalent DIDs. Equivalence was not included in the current specification due to the complexity of verifying equivalence across different DLTs and different DID methods, and also of aggregating properties of equivalent DID Documents. However equivalence should be supported in a future version of this specification.
