 <h1>Terminology</h1>
 
-<p>
-This specification defines the requirements of a conformant DID method
-specification. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
-  "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
-  "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
-  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a> .
-</p>
-
-<p>
-All other terms used in this specification are defined in this glossary.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-Blockchain. A specific type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that
-stores ledger entries in blocks of transactions that are grouped
-together and hashed into a cryptographic chain. Because this type of DLT
-was introduced by <a href=
-  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> , the term
-  "blockchain" is sometimes used to refer specifically to the Bitcoin
-ledger.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-Decentralized identifier (DID). A globally unique identifier that does
-not require a centralized registration authority because it is
-registered with distributed ledger technology or other form of
-decentralized network. The generic format of a DID is defined in this
-specification. A specific DID scheme is defined in a DID method
-specification.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-Decentralized identity management (DIDM). <a href=
-  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management">Identity

-verifiable public key descriptions.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-Dependent. A person, organization, or thing whose DID record is
-registered and maintained by a delegate because the dependent is not in
-a position to control the private keys. A dependent becomes an identity
-owner when the dependent takes control of the private keys.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-DID. Acronym for decentralized identifier.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-DID Document. A JSON data structure containing metadata
-describing a DID, including mechanisms, such as public keys and
-pseudonymous biometrics, that an entity can use to authenticate itself as the
-DID. A DID Document may also contain other <a href=
-  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(computing)">attributes</a> or
-  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims-based_identity">claims</a>
-  describing the entity.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-DID fragment. The portion of a DID reference that follows the first hash
-sign character ("#"). A DID fragment uses the same syntax as a URI
-fragment. See section 5.5. Note that a DID fragment MUST immediately
-follow a DID. If a DID reference includes a DID path followed by a
-fragment, that fragment is NOT a DID fragment.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-DID method. A definition of how a specific DID scheme can be implemented
-on a specific distributed ledger or network, including the precise
-method(s) by which DIDs and DID Documents can be read, written, and revoked.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-DID method conformance profile. A specification (or section of a
-specification) that defines the rules an implementer must follow in
-order to conform with another DID method specification. A conformance
-profile narrows the set of options that may be used in order to meet a
-specific implementation goal.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-DID method specification. The specification for a specific DID scheme
-and DID method that is conformant with the requirements of this
-specification.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-DID path. The portion of a DID reference that follows the first forward
-slash character. A DID path uses the identical syntax as a URI path. See
-section 5.4. Note that if a DID path is followed by a fragment, that
-fragment is NOT a DID fragment.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-DID reference. A DID plus an optional DID path or DID fragment.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-DID scheme. The formal syntax of a DID identifier. The generic DID

-does not yet have the capacity to control the private keys. The
-dependent must rely on the delegate to safeguard the private keys until
-the dependent can assume control and become an entity.
-</p>
-
-<p>
-Identity owner. The natural person, party, organization, or thing whose
-identity is represented by a DID record and who directly controls the
-private keys to control that record. (Note: this specification avoids
-the term "user" since an entity is not always an individual
-person.)
