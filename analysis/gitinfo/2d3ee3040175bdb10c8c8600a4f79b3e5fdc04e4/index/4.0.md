Example DIDs and DDOs This is an example of a DID: did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp Example Owner-Managed DDO Following is an example of a DDO that describes the DID above. This example assumes that the identity owner—the entity that controls the private keys for this identity—is authoritative for the DDO. See section 2.2 for an example of a DDO created by a guardian. For the authoritative JSON-LD context definition, see Appendix B (the URL for the @context property below is just for illustration). { "@context": "https://example.org/did/v1", "id": "did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp", "owner": [{ "id": "did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp#key-1", "type": ["CryptographicKey", "EdDsaPublicKey"], "curve": "ed25519", "expires": "2017-02-08T16:02:20Z", "publicKeyBase64": "lji9qTtkCydxtez/bt1zdLxVMMbz4SzWvlqgOBmURoM=" }, { "id": "did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp#key-2", "type": ["CryptographicKey", "RsaPublicKey"], "expires": "2017-03-22T00:00:00Z", "publicKeyPem": "----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\r\nMIIB.. ... sGbFmgQaRyV\r\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----" }], "control": [{ "type": "OrControl", "signer": [ "did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp", "did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1j" ] }], "service": { "openid": "https://openid.example.com/456", "xdi": "https://xdi.example.com/123" }, "created": "2002-10-10T17:00:00Z", "updated": "2016-10-17T02:41:00Z", "signature": { "type": "RsaSignature2016", "created": "2016-02-08T16:02:20Z", "creator": "did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1j#key/1", "signatureValue": "IOmA4R7TfhkYTYW8...CBMq2/gi25s=" } } Example Guardian- Managed DDO Following is a second example of a DDO that describes the DID above. In this case the DDO describes a dependent—an entity who is not currently in a position to control the private keys for this identity. This DDO was created by a guardian—a separate identity owner with its own DID that serves as a trustee for the dependent. Note that while this DDO asserts a set of service endpoints, it does not yet contain a set of key descriptions because the dependent does not yet have its own set of private keys. { "@context": "https://example.org/did/v1", "id": "did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp", "guardian": "did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1j" "control": [ "did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1j" ], "service": { "openid": "https://openid.example.com/456", "xdi": "https://xdi.example.com/123" }, "type": "http://schema.org/Person", "created": "2002-10-10T17:00:00Z", "updated": "2016-10-17T02:41:00Z", "signature": { "type": "RsaSignature2016", "created": "2016-02-08T16:02:20Z", "creator": "did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1j#key-1", "signatureValue": "IOmA4R7Tf...3CBMq2/gi25s=" } }
