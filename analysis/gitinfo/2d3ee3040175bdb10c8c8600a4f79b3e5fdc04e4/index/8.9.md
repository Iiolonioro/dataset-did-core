Signature (Optional) A signature on a DDO is cryptographic proof of the integrity of the DDO according to either: The identity owner as defined in section 6.4, or if not present: The guardian as defined in section 6.3. This signature is NOT proof of the binding between a DID and a DDO. See section 9.2. The rules for a signature are: A DDO MAY have exactly one property representing a signature. The key for this property MUST be signature. The value of this key MUST be a valid JSON-LD signature as defined by Linked Data Signatures . Example: { "signature": { "type": "LinkedDataSignature2015", "created": "2016-02-08T16:02:20Z", "creator": "did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1ja#keys-1", "signatureValue": "QNB13Y7Q9oLlDLL6AHyL31OE5fLji9DwJSA8qnv81oRaKonij8m+Jv4XdiEYvJ97iRlzKU/92/0LafSL5JftEgl960DLcbqMFxOtbAmFOIMa7eDcrgTL5ytXeYCYKLjHQG3s8a3UKDKRuEK54qK1G5hGKGoLgAVa6xgcDLjW7M19PEJV/c3HpGA7Eez6VFMoTt4yESjZvOXC97xN3KpshOx2HT/btgUbo0XjA1Oi0QHdgrLcUsQGt6w23RjeSToalrsA1G69OFeN2OiQrz9Jb4561hvKLSyWObwRmS6n5Vgr5xkvUm6MONRq0Vg33kXevoVM64KTBkISul61tzjn4w==" } }
