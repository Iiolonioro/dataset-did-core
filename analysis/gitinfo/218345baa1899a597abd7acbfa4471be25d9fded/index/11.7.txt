Alternate Serializations and Graph Models



      This version of the specification relies on JSON-LD and the RDF graph model for expressing a DID Description. Future versions of this specification MAY specify other semantic graph formats for a DID Description, such as JXD (JSON XDI Data), a serialization format for the XDI graph model as defined by the
        OASIS XDI Core 1.0 specification
      .
