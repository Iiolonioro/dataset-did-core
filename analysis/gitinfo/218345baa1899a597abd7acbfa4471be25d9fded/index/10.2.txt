Keep Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) Off-Ledger



      If a DID method specification is written for a public ledger or network where all DIDs and DID Descriptions will be publicly available, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that DID Descriptions contain no PII. All PII should be kept off-ledger behind service endpoints under the control of the identity owner. With this privacy architecture, PII may be exchanged on a private, peer-to-peer basis using communications channels identified and secured by key descriptions in DID records. This also enables identity owners and relying parties to implement the
        GDPR
right to be forgotten
      , as no PII will be written to an immutable ledger.
