DID Persistence A DID MUST be persistent and immutable, i.e., bound to an entity once and never changed (forever). Ideally a DID would be a completely abstract decentralized identifier (like a UUID) that could be bound to multiple underlying distributed ledgers or networks over time, thus maintaining its persistence independent of any particular ledger or network. However registering the same identifier on multiple ledgers or networks introduces extremely hard entityship and start-of-authority (SOA) problems. It also greatly increases implementation complexity for developers. To avoid these issues, it is RECOMMENDED that DID method specifications only produce DIDs and DID methods bound to strong, stable ledgers or networks capable of making the highest level of commitment to persistence of the DID and DID method over time. NOTE: Although not included in this version, future versions of this specification may support a DID Document equivID property to establish verifiable equivalence relations between DID records representing the same identity owner on multiple ledgers or networks. Such equivalence relations can produce the practical equivalent of a single persistent abstract DID. See Future Work (Section ).
