DID Fragments A generic DID fragment (the did-fragment rule in Section ) is identical to a URI fragment and MUST conform to the ABNF of the fragment ABNF rule in RFC 3986. A DID fragment MUST be used only as a method-independent pointer into the DID Document to identify a unique key description or other DID Document component. To resolve this pointer, the complete DID reference including the DID fragment MUST be used as the value of the id key for the target JSON object. A specific DID scheme MAY specify ABNF rules for DID fragments that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
