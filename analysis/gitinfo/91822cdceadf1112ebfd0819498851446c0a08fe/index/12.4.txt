9.4 Non-Repudiation


    
      Non-repudiation of DIDs and DDO updates is supported under the assumption that: (1) the identity owner is monitoring for unauthorized updates (see section 9.5) and (2) the identity owner has had adequate opportunity to revoke malicious updates according to the DID method's access control mechanism (section 6.5). This capability is further supported if timestamps are included (sections 6.7 and 6.8) and the target DLT system supports timestamps.
