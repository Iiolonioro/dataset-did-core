9.7 Key Revocation and Recovery Section 7 specifies the DID operations that
must be supported by a DID method specification, including revocation of a DDO
by replacing it with an updated DDO. In general, checking for key revocation
on DLT-based methods is expected to be handled in a manner similar to checking
the balance of a cryptocurrency account on a distributed ledger: if the
balance is empty, the entire DID is revoked. DID method specifications SHOULD
enable support for a quorum of trusted parties to enable key recovery. Some of
the facilities to do so are suggested in section 6.5, Proof of Control. Note
that not all DID method specifications will recognize control from DIDs
registered using other DID methods and they MAY restrict third-party control
to DIDs that use the same method. Access control and key recovery in a DID
method specification MAY also include a time lock feature to protect against
key compromise by maintaining a second track of control for recovery. Further
specification of this type of control is a matter for future work (see section
11.4).
