6.3. Guardian (Required If No Proof of Ownership)


    
      A guardian is an identity owner who creates and maintains an identity record for a dependent who is not in a position to hold or control the necessary cryptographic keys (e.g., a parent creating an identity record for a child). In this case, there are no owner keys to represent the ultimate identity owner. So the DDO needs to assert the identity of the guardian.

    
      The rules for a guardian are:




A DDO that includes an owner (section 6.4) MAY have a guardian.
  
A DDO that does not include an owner MUST have a guardian.
  
The key for this property MUST be guardian.
  
The value of this key MUST be a valid DID.
  
The guardian DID MUST resolve to a DDO that has an owner property,
i.e., the guardian relationships must not be nested.
  



    
      Example:





      {
      "guardian": "did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1j"
      }
