The W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group has published this document as a
W3C Candidate Recommendation and is requesting that software developers and DID
Method specification authors provide experimental implementations designed to
test the implementability of all of the features in this document.
    </p>
<p>
To exit the W3C Candidate Recommendation phase, the W3C DID Working Group will
require two things: 1) for normative statements that are machine testable, at
least two interoperable implementations per feature, and 2) for normative
statements that are not machine testable, at least two demonstrations of
implementation per feature. A feature is defined as one or more functionally
related normative statements in the specification.
    </p>
<p>
At present, there exist
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/#did-methods">82
experimental DID Method specifications</a>, 32 experimental DID Method driver
implementations, and a Candidate Recommendation <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/">test suite</a> that determines
whether or not a given implementation is conformant with this specification.
Readers are advised to heed the  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues">DID Core issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues"> DID Core Test Suite
issues</a> that each contain the latest list of concerns and proposed changes
that might result in alterations to this specification.
    </p>
<p>
Changes since the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/WD-did-core-20191107/">First Public Working
Draft</a> include:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
The introduction of an abstract data model that can be serialized to multiple
representations including JSON, JSON-LD, and CBOR.
      </li>
<li>
The introduction of a DID Specifications Registry for the purposes of
registering extension properties, representations, DID Resolution input
metadata and output metadata, DID Document metadata, DID parameters, and  DID
Methods.
      </li>
<li>
Separation of DID Document metadata, such as created and updated values,
from DID Document properties.
      </li>
<li>
The removal of embedded proofs in the DID Document.
      </li>
<li>
The addition of verification relationships for the purposes of authentication,
assertion, key agreement, capability invocation and capability delegation.
      </li>
<li>
The ability to support relating multiple identifiers with the DID Document,
such as the DID controller, also known as, equivalent IDs, and canonical IDs.
      </li>
<li>
Enhancing privacy by reducing information that could contain personally
identifiable information in the DID Document.
      </li>
<li>
The addition of a large section on security considerations and privacy
considerations.
      </li>
<li>
A Representations section that details how the abstract data model can be
produced and consumed in a variety of different formats along with general
rules for all representations, producers, and consumers.
      </li>
<li>
A section detailing the DID Resolution and DID URL Dereferencing interface
definition that all DID resolvers are expected to expose as well as inputs
and outputs to those processes.
      </li>
<li>
DID Document examples in an appendix that provide more complex examples of
DID Document serializations.
      </li>
<li>
IANA Considerations for multiple representations specified in DID Core.
      </li>
<li>
Removal of the Future Work section as much of the work has now been
accomplished.
      </li>
<li>
An acknowledgements section.
      </li>
</ul>
