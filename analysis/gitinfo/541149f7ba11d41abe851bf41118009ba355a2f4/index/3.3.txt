Motivations for DIDs

The growing need for decentralized identity has produced three specific
requirements for a new type of URI that still fits within URI/URL/URN
architecture but in a less than traditional way:



A URI that is persistent like a URN yet can be resolved or
de-referenced to locate a resource like a URL. In essence, a DID is a
URI that serves both functions.
  

A URI that does not require a centralized authority to register,
resolve, update, or revoke. The overwhelming majority of URIs today are
based on DNS names or IP addresses that depend on centralized
authorities for registration and ultimate control. DIDs can be created
and managed without any such authority.
  

A URI whose ownership and associated metadata, including public
keys, can be cryptographically verified. Control of DIDs and DDOs
leverages the same public/private key cryptography as distributed
ledgers.
