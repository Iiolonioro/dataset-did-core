Primary DID (Required) The primary DID is the primary index key for the DDO,
i.e., it is DID described by DDO. The rules for a primary DID are: A DDO MUST
have exactly one primary DID. The key for this property MUST be id. The value
of this key MUST be a valid DID. When this DDO is registered with the target
distributed ledger or network, the registered DID MUST match this primary DID
value. Example: { "id": "did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp" }
