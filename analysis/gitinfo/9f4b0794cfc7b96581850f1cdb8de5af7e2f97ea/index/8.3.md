DID Paths A generic DID path (the did-path rule in section 5.1) is identical to a URI path and MUST conform to the ABNF of the path-rootless ABNF rule in RFC 3986 . A DID path SHOULD be used to address resources available via a DID service endpoint. See section 6.6. A specific DID scheme MAY specify ABNF rules for DID paths that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.
