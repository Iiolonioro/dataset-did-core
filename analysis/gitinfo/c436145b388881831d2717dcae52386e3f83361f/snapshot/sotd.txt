The W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group has published this document as a
W3C Candidate Recommendation and is requesting that software developers and DID
Method specification authors provide experimental implementations designed to
test the implementability of all of the features in this document.
    </p>
<p>
To exit the W3C Candidate Recommendation phase, the W3C DID Working Group will
require two things: 1) for normative statements that are machine testable, at
least two interoperable implementations per feature, and 2) for normative
statements that are not machine testable, at least two demonstrations of
implementation per feature. A feature is defined as one or more functionally
related normative statements in the specification.
    </p>
<p>
At present, there exist
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/#did-methods">82
experimental DID Method specifications</a>, 32 experimental DID Method driver
implementations, and a Candidate Recommendation <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/">test suite</a> that determines
whether or not a given implementation is conformant with this specification.
Readers are advised to heed the  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues">DID Core issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues"> DID Core Test Suite
issues</a> that each contain the latest list of concerns and proposed changes
that might result in alterations to this specification.
