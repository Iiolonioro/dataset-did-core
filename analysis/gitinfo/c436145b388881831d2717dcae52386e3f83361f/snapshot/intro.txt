<p>
<a>Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A <a>DID</a> identifies any
subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)
that the controller of the <a>DID</a> decides that it identifies. In contrast to
typical, federated identifiers, <a>DIDs</a> have been designed so that they may
be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate
authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the
discovery of information related to a <a>DID</a>, the design enables the
controller of a <a>DID</a> to prove control over it without requiring permission
from any other party. <a>DIDs</a> are <a>URIs</a> that associate a <a>DID
subject</a> with a <a>DID document</a> allowing trustable interactions
associated with that subject.
    </p>
<p>
Each <a>DID document</a> can express cryptographic material, <a>verification
methods</a>, or <a>services</a>, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a
<a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the <a>DID</a>. <a>Services</a> enable
trusted interactions associated with the <a>DID subject</a>. A <a>DID</a> might
provide the means to return the <a>DID subject</a> itself, if the <a>DID
subject</a> is an information resource such as a data model.
    </p>
<p>
This document specifies the DID syntax, a common data model, core properties,
serialized representations, DID operations, and an explanation of the process
of resolving DIDs to the resources that they represent.

The W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group has published this document as a
W3C Candidate Recommendation and is requesting that software developers and DID
Method specification authors provide experimental implementations designed to
test the implementability of all of the features in this document.
    </p>
<p>
To exit the W3C Candidate Recommendation phase, the W3C DID Working Group will
require two things: 1) for normative statements that are machine testable, at
least two interoperable implementations per feature, and 2) for normative
statements that are not machine testable, at least two demonstrations of
implementation per feature. A feature is defined as one or more functionally
related normative statements in the specification.
    </p>
<p>
At present, there exist
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/#did-methods">82
experimental DID Method specifications</a>, 32 experimental DID Method driver
implementations, and a Candidate Recommendation <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/">test suite</a> that determines
whether or not a given implementation is conformant with this specification.
Readers are advised to heed the  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues">DID Core issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues"> DID Core Test Suite
issues</a> that each contain the latest list of concerns and proposed changes
that might result in alterations to this specification.
