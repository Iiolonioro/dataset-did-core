DID Normalization

For the broadest interoperability, DID normalization should be as simple
and universal as possible. Therefore:



The did: scheme name MUST be lowercase.
  

The method name MUST be lowercase.
  

Case sensitivity and normalization of the value of the
specific-idstring rule in Section 
MUST be defined by the governing DID method specification.
