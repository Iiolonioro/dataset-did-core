Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables
verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject
(e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that
the controller of the DID decides that it identifies. These new identifiers
are designed to enable the controller of a DID to prove control over it and to
be implemented independently of any centralized registry, identity provider,
or certificate authority. DIDs are URLs that associate a DID subject with a
DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.
Each DID document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or
service endpoints, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID controller
to prove control of the DID. Service endpoints enable trusted interactions
associated with the DID subject. A DID document might contain semantics about
the subject that it identifies. A DID document might contain the DID subject
itself (e.g. a data model).

This document specifies a common data model, a URL format, and a set of
operations for DIDs, DID documents, and DID methods.

This specification is under active development and implementers are advised
against implementing the specification unless they are directly involved with
the W3C DID Working Group. There are use cases [[?DID-USE-CASES]] in active
development that establish requirements for this document.

At present, there exist [40 experimental
implementations](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/#the-registry)
and a preliminary [test suite](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-test-suite/)
that will eventually determine whether or not implementations are conformant.
Readers are advised that Appendix  contains a list of concerns and proposed
changes that will most likely result in alterations to this specification.

#  Introduction

As individuals and organizations, many of us use globally unique identifiers
in a wide variety of contexts. They serve as communications addresses
(telephone numbers, email addresses, usernames on social media), ID numbers
(for passports, drivers licenses, tax IDs, health insurance), and product
identifiers (serial numbers, barcodes, RFIDs). Resources on the Internet are
identified by globally unique identifiers in the form of MAC addresses; URIs
(Uniform Resource Identfiers) are used for resources on the Web and each web
page you view in a browser has a globally unique URL (Uniform Resource
Locator).

The vast majority of these globally unique identifiers are not under our
control. They are issued by external authorities that decide who or what they
identify and when they can be revoked. They are useful only in certain
contexts and recognised only by certain bodies (not of our choosing). They may
disappear or cease to be valid with the failure of an organization. They may
unnecessarily reveal personal information. And in many cases they can be
fraudulently replicated and asserted by a malicious third-party ("identity
theft").

The Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) defined in this specification are a new
type of globally unique identifier designed to enable individuals and
organizations to generate our own identifiers using systems we trust, and to
prove control of those identifiers (authenticate) using cryptographic proofs
(for example, digital signatures, privacy-preserving biometric protocols, and
so on).

Because we control the generation and assertion of these identifiers, each of
us can have as many DIDs as we need to respect our desired separation of
identities, personas, and contexts (in the everyday sense of these words). We
can scope the use of these identifiers to the most appropriate contexts. We
can interact with other people, institutions or systems that require us to
identify ourselves (or things we control) while maintaining control over how
much personal or private data should be revealed, and without depending on a
central authority to guarantee the continued existence of the identifier.

This specification does not require any particular technology or cryptography
to underpin the generation, persistence, resolution or interpretation of DIDs.
Rather, it defines: a) the generic syntax for all DIDs, and b) the generic
requirements for performing the four basic CRUD operations (create, read,
update, deactivate) on the metadata associated with a DID (called the DID
document).

This enables implementers to design specific types of DIDs to work with the
computing infrastructure they trust (e.g., blockchain, distributed ledger,
decentralized file system, distributed database, peer-to-peer network). The
specification for a specific type of DID is called a DID method. Implementers
of applications or systems using DIDs can choose to support the DID methods
most appropriate for their particular use cases.

This specification is for:

  * Developers who want to enable users of their system to generate and assert their own identifiers (producers of DIDs); 
  * Developers who want to enable their systems to accept user-controlled identifiers (consumers of DIDs); 
  * Developers who wish to enable the use of DIDs with particular computing infrastructure (DID method developers). 

DID methods can also be developed for identifiers registered in federated or
centralized identity management systems. Indeed, almost all types of
identifier systems can add support for DIDs. This creates an interoperability
bridge between the worlds of centralized, federated, and decentralized
identifiers.

##  A Simple Example

A DID is a simple text string consisting of three parts, the:

  * URL scheme identifier (`did`) 
  * Identifier for the DID method
  * DID method-specific identifier. 

    
    
    did:example:123456789abcdefghi
          

The example DID above resolves to a DID document. A DID document contains
information associated with the DID, such as ways to cryptographically
authenticate the DID controller, as well as services that can be used to
interact with the DID subject.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "authentication": [{
        // used to authenticate as did:...fghi
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
        "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
      }],
      "service": [{
        // used to retrieve Verifiable Credentials associated with the DID
        "id":"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vcs",
        "type": "VerifiableCredentialService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/vc/"
      }]
    }
          

##  Design Goals

Decentralized Identifiers are a component of larger systems, such as the
Verifiable Credentials ecosystem [[VC-DATA-MODEL]], which drove the design
goals for this specification. This section summarizes the primary design goals
for this specification.

Goal  |  Description  
---|---  
Decentralization  |  Eliminate the requirement for centralized authorities or
single point failure in identifier management, including the registration of
globally unique identifiers, public verification keys, service endpoints, and
other metadata.  
Control  |  Give entities, both human and non-human, the power to directly
control their digital identifiers without the need to rely on external
authorities.  
Privacy  |  Enable entities to control the privacy of their information,
including minimal, selective, and progressive disclosure of attributes or
other data.  
Security  |  Enable sufficient security for relying parties to depend on DID
documents for their required level of assurance.  
Proof-based  |  Enable DID controllers to provide cryptographic proof when
interacting with other entities.  
Discoverability  |  Make it possible for entities to discover DIDs for other
entities, to learn more about or interact with those entities.  
Interoperability  |  Use interoperable standards so DID infrastructure can
make use of existing tools and software libraries designed for
interoperability.  
Portability  |  Be system- and network-independent and enable entities to use
their digital identifiers with any system that supports DIDs and DID methods.  
Simplicity  |  Favor a reduced set of simple features to make the technology
easier to understand, implement, and deploy.  
Extensibility  |  Where possible, enable extensibility provided it does not
greatly hinder interoperability, portability, or simplicity.  
  
##  Architecture Overview

This section provides a basic understanding of the major elements of DID
architecture. Formal definitions of terms are provided in .

DID resolver.

          ](diagrams/did_architecture_overview.svg) The basic components of DID architecture. 

DIDs and DID URLs

     A DID, or Decentralized Identifier, is a URI composed of three parts: the scheme "did:", a method identifier, and a unique, method-specific identifier generated by the DID method. DIDs are resolvable to DID documents. A DID URL extends the syntax of a basic DID to incorporate other standard URI components (path, query, fragment) in order to locate a particular resource--for example, a public key inside a DID document, or a resource available external to the DID document. 
DID Subjects

     The subject of a DID is, by definition, the entity identified by the DID. The DID subject may also be the DID controller. Anything can be the subject of a DID: person, group, organization, physical thing, logical thing, etc. 
DID Controllers

     The controller of a DID is the entity (person, organization, or autonomous software) that has the capability--as defined by a DID method--to make changes to a DID document. This capability is typically asserted by the control of a set of cryptographic keys used by software acting on behalf of the controller, though it may also be asserted via other mechanisms. Note that a DID may have more than one controller, and the controller(s) may include the DID subject. 
Verifiable Data Registries

     In order to be resolvable to DID documents, DIDs are typically recorded on an underlying system or network of some kind. Regardless of the specific technology used, any such system that supports recording DIDs and returning data necessary to produce DID documents is called a verifiable data registry. Examples include distributed ledgers, decentralized file systems, databases of any kind, peer-to-peer networks, and other forms of trusted data storage. 
DID documents

     DID documents contain metadata associated with a DID. They typically express verification methods (such as public keys) and services relevant to interactions with the DID subject. A DID document is serialized according to a particular syntax (see ). The DID itself is the value of the `id` property. The generic properties supported in a DID document are specified in . The properties present in a DID document may be updated according to the applicable operations outlined in . 
DID Methods

     DID methods are the mechanism by which a particular type of DID and its associated DID document are created, resolved, updated, and deactivated using a particular verifiable data registry. DID methods are defined using separate DID method specifications (see ). 

Conceptually, the relationship between this specification and a DID method
specification is similar to the relationship between the IETF generic URI
specification ([[RFC3986]]) and a specific URI scheme ([[IANA-URI-SCHEMES]]
(such as the http: and https: schemes specified in [[RFC7230]]). It is also
similar to the relationship between the IETF generic URN specification
([[RFC8141]]) and a specific URN namespace definition, (such as the UUID URN
namespace defined in [[RFC4122]]). The difference is that a DID method
specification, as well as defining a specific DID scheme, also specifies the
methods creating, resolving, updating, and deactivating DIDs and DID documents
using a specific type of verifiable data registry.

DID resolvers and DID resolution

     A DID resolver is a software and/or hardware component that takes a DID (and associated options) as input and produces a conforming DID document (and associated metadata) as output. This process is called DID resolution. The inputs and outputs of the DID resolution process are defined in . The specific steps for resolving a specific type of DID are defined by the relevant DID method specification. Additional considerations for implementing a DID resolver are discussed in [[DID-RESOLUTION]]. 
DID URL dereferencers and DID URL dereferencing

     A DID URL dereferencer is a software and/or hardware component that takes a DID URL (and associated options) as input and produces a resource (and associated metadata) as output. This process is called DID URL dereferencing. The inputs and outputs of the DID URL dereferencing process are defined in . Additional considerations for implementing a DID URL dereferencer are discussed in [[DID-RESOLUTION]]. 

This document contains examples that contain JSON, CBOR, and JSON-LD content.
Some of these examples contain characters that are invalid, such as inline
comments (`//`) and the use of ellipsis (`...`) to denote information that
adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to remove this
content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON, CBOR, or JSON-LD.

Interoperability of implementations for DIDs and DID documents will be tested
by evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse DIDs and DID
documents that conform to the specification. Interoperability for producers
and consumers of DIDs and DID documents is provided by ensuring the DIDs and
DID documents conform. Interoperability for DID method specifications is
provided by the details in each DID method specification. It is understood
that, in the same way that a web browser is not required to implement all
known URI schemes, conformant software that works with DIDs is not required to
implement all known DID methods (however, all implementations of a given DID
method must be interoperable for that method).

A conforming DID is any concrete expression of the rules specified in Section
and MUST comply with relevant normative statements in that section.

A conforming DID Document is any concrete expression of the data model
described in this specification and MUST comply with the relevant normative
statements in Sections  and . A serialization format for the conforming
document MUST be deterministic, bi-directional, and lossless as described in
Section . The conforming DID document MAY be transmitted or stored in any such
serialization format.

A conforming DID Method is any specification that complies with the relevant
normative statements in Section .

A producer is any algorithm realized as software and/or hardware and conforms
to this specification if it generates conforming DIDs or conforming DID
Documents. A producer that is conformant with this specification MUST NOT
produce non-conforming DIDs or DID Documents.

A consumer is any algorithm realized as software and/or hardware and conforms
to this specification if it consumes conforming DIDs or conforming DID
Documents. A consumer that is conformant with this specification MUST produce
errors when consuming non-conforming DIDs or DID Documents.

##  Terminology

## Identifier

This section describes the formal syntax for DIDs and DID URLs. The term
"generic" is used to differentiate the syntax defined here from syntax defined
by _specific_ DID methods in their respective specifications.

### DID Syntax

## Generic DID Syntax

The generic DID scheme is a URI scheme conformant with [[!RFC3986]].

A DID always identifies the DID subject.

The following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [[!RFC5234]], which
defines `ALPHA` and `DIGIT`. All other rule names not defined in this ABNF are
defined in [[RFC3986]].

    
    
    did                = "did:" method-name ":" method-specific-id
    method-name        = 1*method-char
    method-char        = %x61-7A / DIGIT
    method-specific-id = *( ":" *idchar ) 1*idchar
    idchar             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_"
            

The grammar currently allows an empty `method-specific-id`, e.g.,
`did:example:` would be a valid DID that could identify the DID method itself.

## Method-Specific Syntax

A DID method specification MUST further restrict the generic DID syntax by
defining its own `method-name` and its own `method-specific-id` syntax. For
more information, see Section .

## Normalization

For the broadest interoperability, make DID normalization as simple and
universal as possible:

  * The DID scheme name MUST be lowercase. 
  * The DID method name MUST be lowercase. 
  * Case sensitivity and normalization of the value of the `method-specific-id` rule in Section  MUST be defined by the governing DID method specification. 

## Persistence

A DID is expected to be persistent and immutable. That is, a DID is bound
exclusively and permanently to its one and only subject. Even after a DID is
deactivated, it is intended that it never be repurposed.

Ideally, a DID would be a completely abstract decentralized identifier (like a
UUID) that could be bound to multiple underlying DID registries over time,
thus maintaining its persistence independent of any particular system.
However, registering the same identifier on multiple DID registries introduces
extremely hard entityship and [start-of-
authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types%23SOA) (SOA)
problems. It also greatly increases implementation complexity for developers.

To avoid these issues, developers should refer to the Decentralized
Characteristics Rubric [[?DID-RUBRIC]] to decide which DID method best
addresses the needs of the use case.

Although not included in this version, future versions of this specification
might support a DID document `equivID` property to establish verifiable
equivalence relations between DIDs representing the same subject on multiple
verifiable data registries. Such equivalence relations can produce the
practical equivalent of a single persistent abstract DID. For more
information, see Section .

### DID URL Syntax

## Generic DID URL Syntax

A DID URL always identifies a resource to be located. It can be used, for
example, to identify a specific part of a DID document.

This following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [[!RFC5324]]. It
builds on the `did` scheme defined in . The `path-abempty` and `fragment`
components are identical to the ABNF rules defined in [[!RFC3986]], and the
`did-query` component is derived from the `query` ABNF rule.

    
    
    did-url            = did path-abempty [ "?" did-query ]
                         [ "#" fragment ]
    did-query          = param *( "&" param )
    param              = param-name "=" param-value
    param-name         = 1*pchar
    param-value        = *pchar
            

This specification reserves the semicolon (`;`) character for possible future
use as a sub-delimiter for parameters as described in [[?MATRIX-URIS]].

## Generic DID URL Parameters

The DID URL syntax supports a simple, generalized format for parameters based
on the query component (See ). The ABNF above specifies the basic syntax (the
`param` rule) but does not specify any concrete parameter names.

Some generic DID parameter names (for example, for service selection) are
completely independent of any specific DID method and MUST always function the
same way for all DIDs. Other DID parameter names (for example, for versioning)
MAY be supported by certain DID methods, but MUST operate uniformly across
those DID methods that do support them.

Parameter names that are completely method-specific are described in Section .

The following table defines a set of generic DID parameter names.

Generic DID Parameter Name  |  Description  
---|---  
`hl` |  A resource hash of the DID document to add integrity protection, as
specified in [[?HASHLINK]].  
`service` |  Identifies a service from the DID document by service ID.  
`version-id` |  Identifies a specific version of a DID document to be resolved
(the version ID could be sequential, or a UUID, or method-specific). Note that
this parameter might not be supported by all DID methods.  
`version-time` |  Identifies a certain version timestamp of a DID document to
be resolved. That is, the DID document that was valid for a DID at a certain
time. Note that this parameter might not be supported by all DID methods.  
  
Additional considerations for processing these parameters are discussed in
[?DID-RESOLUTION].

Two example DID URLs using the `service` and `version-time` generic DID
parameters are shown below.

    
    
    did:foo:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?service=agent
            
    
    
    did:foo:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?version-time=2002-10-10T17:00:00Z
            

Adding a DID parameter to a DID URL means that the parameter becomes part of
an identifier for a resource (the DID document or other). Alternatively, the
DID resolution and the DID URL dereferencing functions can also be influenced
by passing input metadata to a DID resolver that are not part of the DID URL.
(See ). Such options could for example control caching or the desired encoding
of a resolution result. This is comparable to HTTP, where certain parameters
could either be included in an HTTP URL, or alternatively passed as HTTP
headers during the dereferencing process. The important distinction is that
DID parameters that are part of the DID URL should be used to specify
_whatresource is being identified_, whereas DID resolution options that are
not part of the DID URL should be use to control _how thatresource is resolved
or dereferenced_.

DID parameters MAY be used if there is a clear use case where the parameter
needs to be part of a URI that can be used as a link, or as a resource in RDF
/ JSON-LD documents.

DID parameters SHOULD NOT be used if there are already other, equivalent ways
of constructing URIs that fulfill the same purpose (for example, using other
syntactical constructs such as URI query strings or URI fragments).

DID parameters SHOULD NOT be used if the same functionality can be expressed
by passing options to a DID resolver, and if there is no need to construct a
URI for use as a link, or as a resource in RDF / JSON-LD documents.

## Method-Specific DID URL Parameters

A DID method specification MAY specify additional method-specific parameter
names. A method-specific parameter name MUST be prefixed by the method name,
as defined by the `method-name` rule.

For example, if the method `did:foo:` defines the parameter bar, the parameter
name must be `foo:bar`. An example DID URL using this method and this method-
specific parameter would be as shown below.

    
    
    did:foo:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?foo:bar=high
            

A method-specific parameter name defined by one DID method MAY be used by
other DID methods.

    
    
    did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?foo:bar=low
            

Method-specific parameter names MAY be combined with generic parameter names
in any order.

    
    
    did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?service=agent&foo;:bar=high
            

Both DID method namespaces and method-specific parameter namespaces MAY
include colons, so they might be partitioned hierarchically, as defined by a
DID method specification. The following example DID URL illustrates both.

    
    
    did:foo:baz:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp?foo:baz:hex=b612
            

Review what exactly we want to say about method-specific parameters defined by
one method but used in a DID URL with a different method. Also discuss
hierarchical method namespaces in DID parameter names.

## Path

A DID path is identical to a generic URI path and MUST conform to the `path-
abempty` ABNF rule in [[!RFC3986]]. A DID path SHOULD be used to address
resources available through a service endpoint. For more information, see
Section .

A specific DID scheme MAY specify ABNF rules for DID paths that are more
restrictive than the generic rules in this section.

    
    
    did:example:123456/path
            

## Query

A DID query is derived from a generic URI query and MUST conform to the `did-
query` ABNF rule in Section  . If a DID query is present, it MUST be used as
described in Sections  and .

A specific DID scheme MAY specify ABNF rules for DID queries that are more
restrictive than the generic rules in this section.

    
    
    did:example:123456?query=true
            

## Fragment

A DID fragment is used as method-independent reference into the DID document
to identify a component of the document (for example, a unique public key
description or service endpoint). DID fragment syntax and semantics are
identical to a generic URI fragment and MUST conform to RFC 3986, section 3.5.
To dereference a DID fragment, the complete DID URL including the DID fragment
MUST be used as input to the DID URL dereferencing function for the target
component in the DID document object. For more information, see .

A specific DID scheme MAY specify ABNF rules for DID fragments that are more
restrictive than the generic rules in this section.

    
    
    did:example:123456#public-key-1
            

In order to maximize interoperability, implementers are urged to ensure that
DID fragments are interpreted in the same way across representations (as
described in ). For example, while JSON Pointer [[?RFC6901]] can be used in a
DID fragment, it will not be interpreted in the same way across
representations.

Additional semantics for fragment identifiers, which are compatible with and
layered upon the semantics in this section, are described for JSON-LD
representations in Section .

## Relative DID URLs

A relative DID URL is any URL value in a DID document that does not start with
`did:<method-name>:<method-specific-id>`. More specifically, it is any URL
value that does not start with the ABNF defined in Section . The contents of
the URL typically refers to a resource in the same DID document. Relative DID
URLs MAY contain relative path components, query parameters, and fragment
identifiers.

When resolving a relative DID URL reference, the algorithm specified in
RFC3986 Section 5: Reference Resolution MUST be used. The **base URI** value
is the DID that is associated with the DID subject, see Section . The
**scheme** is `did`. The **authority** is a combination of `<method-
name>:<method-specific-id>`, and the **path** , **query** , and **fragment**
values are those defined in Section , Section , and Section , respectively.

Relative DID URLs are often used to identify verification methods and services
in a DID Document without having to use absolute URLs, which tend to be more
verbose than necessary.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "publicKey": [{
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
        "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
      }, ...],
      "authentication": [
        // a relative DID URL used to reference a verification method above
        "#key-1"
      ]
    }
            

In the example above, the relative DID URL value will be transformed to an
absolute DID URL value of `did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1`.

# Data Model

This specification defines an abstract data model for DID documents,
independent of any specific representation. This section provides a high-level
description of the data model, a set of requirements for representations, and
a set of requirements for extensibility.

## Definition

A DID document consists of a collection of property-value pairs. The
definitions of each of these properties are specified in section . Specific
representations are defined in section .

## Representations

Following are the requirements for representations.

  1. A representation MUST define an unambiguous encoding and decoding of all properties and their associated values as defined in this specification. This means anything you can represent in the DID document data model can be represented in any compliant representation. 
  2. The representation MUST be associated with an IANA-registered MIME type. 
  3. The representation MUST define fragment processing rules for its MIME type that are conformant with the fragment processing rules defined in section  of this specification. 

The core representations are specified in section .

## Extensibility

The data model supports two types of extensibility.

  1. For maximum interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that extensions use the official W3C DID Core Registries mechanism [[DID-CORE-REGISTRIES]]. The use of this mechanism for new properties or other extensions is the only specified method that ensures that two different representations will be able to work together. 
  2. Representations MAY define other extensibility mechanisms including methods for decentralized extensions. Such extension mechanisms MUST support lossless conversion into any other conformant representation. 

It is always possible for two specific implementations to agree out-of-band to
use a mutually understood extension or representation that is not recorded in
the DID Core Registries [[DID-CORE-REGISTRIES]]; interoperability between such
implementations and the larger ecosystem will be less reliable.

# Core Properties

A DID points to a DID document. DID documents are the serialization of the
data model outlined in Section . The following sections define the properties
in a DID document, including whether these properties are required or
optional.

##  Identifiers

Identifiers are used in the data model to identify specific instances of
people, organizations, devices, keys, services, and things in general.
Identifiers are typically URLs, or more generally, URIs. Non-URI-based
identifiers are not advised because, while the data model supports them, they
are not easy to use with other Internet-based identifiers.

## DID Subject

The DID subject is denoted with the `id` property. The DID subject is the
entity that the DID document is about. That is, it is the entity identified by
the DID and described by the DID document.

DID documents MUST include the `id` property.

id

     The value of `id` MUST be a single valid DID. 
    
    
    {
      "id": "did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp"
    }
          

DID method specifications can create intermediate representations of a DID
document that do not contain the `id` key, such as when a DID resolver is
performing DID resolution. However, the fully resolved DID document always
contains a valid `id` property. The value of `id` in the resolved DID document
is expected to match the DID that was resolved.

## Verification Methods

A DID document can express verification methods, such as cryptographic keys,
which can be used to authenticate or authorize interactions with the DID
subject or associated parties. The information expressed often includes
globally unambiguous identifiers and public key material, which can be used to
verify digital signatures. For example, a public key can be used as a
verification method with respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it
verifies that the signer possessed the associated private key.

Verification methods might take many parameters. An example of this is a set
of five cryptographic keys from which any three are required to contribute to
a threshold signature. Methods need not be cryptographic. An example of this
might be the contact information for a biometric service provider that
compares a purported DID controller against a candidate biometric vector.

A DID document MAY include a `verificationMethod` property.

verificationMethod

     If a DID document includes a `verificationMethod` property, the value of the property MUST be an array of verification method objects. Each verification method object MUST have the `id`, `type`, `controller`, and specific verification method properties. The verification method objects MAY include additional properties. 

The value of the `id` property MUST be a URI. The array of verification
methods MUST NOT contain multiple entries with the same `id`. If the array of
verification methods contains multiple entries with the same `id`, a DID
document processor MUST produce an error.

The value of the `type` property MUST be exactly one verification method type.
In order to maximize global interoperability, the verification method type
SHOULD be registered in the [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

The value of the `controller` property, MUST be a valid DID.

In order to maximize global interoperability, the verification method
properties SHOULD be registered in the [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

    
    
    {
      "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1", "https://w3id.org/security/v1"],
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "verificationMethod": [{
        "id": ...,
        "type": ...,
        "controller": ...,
        ...
      ]}
    }
          

### Verification relationships

A verification relationship expresses the relationship between the DID subject
and a verification method.

A DID document MAY include a property expressing a specific verification
relationship. In order to maximize global interoperability, the property
SHOULD be registered in [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

A DID controller MUST be explicit about the verification relationship between
the DID subject and the verification method. Verification methods that are not
associated with a particular verification relationship MUST NOT be used for
that verification relationship. See Section  for a more detailed example of a
verification relationship.

## Public Keys

A public key is a verification method. Public keys are used for digital
signatures, encryption and other cryptographic operations, which in turn are
the basis for purposes such as authentication (see Section ) or establishing
secure communication with service endpoints (see Section ). As well, public
keys can play a role in authorization mechanisms of DID method operations (see
Section ), which can be defined by DID method specifications.

Public keys can be included in a DID document using the `publicKey` or
`authentication` properties, depending on what they are to be used for. Each
public key has an identifier (`id`) of its own, a `type`, and a `controller`,
as well as other properties that depend on the type of key it is.

This specification strives to limit the number of formats for expressing
public key material in a DID Document to the fewest possible, to increase the
likelihood of interoperability. The fewer formats that implementers have to
implement, the more likely it will be that they will support all of them. This
approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between ease of implementation
and supporting formats that have historically had broad deployment. The
specific types of key formats that are supported in this specification are
listed below.

A DID document MAY include a `publicKey` property.

publicKey

     If a DID document includes a `publicKey` property, the value of the property MUST be an array of public key objects. Each public key object MUST have the `type`, `controller`, and specific public key properties, and MUST have an `id` property. The public key objects MAY include additional properties. 

The value of the `id` property MUST be a URI. The array of public keys MUST
NOT contain multiple entries with the same `id`. In this case, a DID document
processor MUST produce an error.

The value of the `type` property MUST be exactly one public key type. For a
registry of available key types and formats, see [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

The value of the `controller` property, which identifies the controller of the
corresponding private key, MUST be a valid DID.

The semantics of the `controller` property are the same when the subject of
the relationship is the DID document as when the subject of the relationship
is a key. Since a key can't control itself, and the key controller cannot be
inferred from the DID document, it is necessary to explicitly express the
identity of the controller of the key (which may be the DID controller or DID
subject). The difference is that the value of `controller` on a key is not
necessarily a DID controller. DID controller(s) are expressed using the
`controller` property on the top level of the DID document; see Section .

The value of the `id` property MAY be structured as a [compound
key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_key). This is especially useful
for integrating with existing key management systems and key formats such as
[JWK](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517). It is RECOMMENDED that
[JWK](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) `kid` values are set to the [public
key fingerprint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7638). It is RECOMMENDED that
verification methods that use JWKs to represent their public keys utilize the
value of `kid` as their fragment identifier. See the first key in EXAMPLE 12
for an example of a public key with a compound key identifier.

All public key properties MUST be registered in the [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

If a public key does not exist in the DID document, it MUST be assumed the key
was revoked or is invalid. The DID document MAY NOT contain revoked keys. Each
DID method specification is expected to detail how revocation is performed and
tracked.

Public keys of all types MUST be expressed in either JSON Web Key (JWK) format
using the `publicKeyJwk` property or one of the formats listed in the table
below. Public key expression MUST NOT use any other key format.

The Working Group is still debating whether the base encoding format used will
be Base58 (Bitcoin) [[BASE58]], base64url [[RFC7515]], or base16 (hex)
[[RFC4648]]. The entries in the table below currently assume PEM and Base58
(Bitcoin), but might change to base64url and/or base16 (hex) after the group
achieves consensus on this particular issue.

The Working Group is still debating whether secp256k1 Schnorr public key
values will be elaborated upon in this specification and if so, how they will
be expressed and encoded.

Key Type  |  Support  
---|---  
RSA  |  RSA public key values MUST either be encoded as a JWK or be encoded in
Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format using the `publicKeyPem` property.  
ed25519  |  Ed25519 public key values MUST either be encoded as a JWK or be
encoded as the raw 32-byte public key value in Base58 Bitcoin format using the
`publicKeyBase58` property.  
secp256k1-koblitz  |  Secp256k1 Koblitz public key values MUST either be
encoded as a JWK or be encoded as the raw 33-byte public key value in Base58
Bitcoin format using the `publicKeyBase58` property.  
secp256r1  |  Secp256r1 public key values MUST either be encoded as a JWK or
be encoded as the raw 32-byte public key value encoded in Base58 Bitcoin
format using the `publicKeyBase58` property.  
Curve25519  |  Curve25519 (also known as X25519) public key values MUST either
be encoded as a JWK or be encoded as the raw 32-byte public key value in
Base58 Bitcoin format using the `publicKeyBase58` property.  
  
Example:

    
    
    {
      "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1", "https://w3id.org/security/v1"],
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "publicKey": [{
        "id": "did:example:123#_Qq0UL2Fq651Q0Fjd6TvnYE-faHiOpRlPVQcY_-tA4A",
        "type": "JwsVerificationKey2020",
        "controller": "did:example:123",
        "publicKeyJwk": {
          "crv": "Ed25519",
          "x": "VCpo2LMLhn6iWku8MKvSLg2ZAoC-nlOyPVQaO3FxVeQ",
          "kty": "OKP",
          "kid": "_Qq0UL2Fq651Q0Fjd6TvnYE-faHiOpRlPVQcY_-tA4A"
        }
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
        "controller": "did:example:pqrstuvwxyz0987654321",
        "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
        "type": "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",
        "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyHex": "02b97c30de767f084ce3080168ee293053ba33b235d7116a3263d29f1450936b71"
      }],
      ...
    }
          

A key MAY be _embedded_ or _referenced_ in a DID document. For example, the
`authentication` property might refer to keys in both ways, as shown in the
example below.

    
    
    {
    ...
    
      "authentication": [
        // this key is referenced, it may be used with more than one verification relationship
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        // this key is embedded and may *only* be used for authentication
        {
          "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
          "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
          "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
          "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        }
      ],
    
    ...
    }
          

The steps to use when processing a `publicKey` property in a DID document are:

  1. Let _value_ be the data associated with the `publicKey` property and initialize _result_ to `null`. 
  2. If _value_ is an object, the key material is embedded. Set _result_ to _value_. 
  3. If _value_ is a string, the key is included by reference. Assume _value_ is a URL. 
    1. Dereference the URL and retrieve the `publicKey` properties associated with the URL. For example, process the `publicKey` property at the top-level of the dereferenced document. 
    2. Iterating through each public key object, if the `id` property of the object matches _value_ , set _result_ to the object. 
  4. If _result_ does not contain at least the `id`, `type`, and `controller` properties, as well as any mandatory public cryptographic material, as determined by the `type` property of _result_ , throw an error. 

Caching and expiration of the keys in a DID document is entirely the
responsibility of DID resolvers and other clients. For more information, see
Section .

## Authentication

Authentication is a mechanism by which an entity can prove it is the DID
subject. The _verifier_ of an authentication attempt can check if the
authenticating party is presenting a valid proof of authentication, that is,
that they are who they say they are. Note that a successful authentication on
its own may or may not confer authority; that is up to the verifying
application.

If authentication is established, it is up to the DID method or other
application to decide what to do with that information. A particular DID
method could decide that authenticating as a DID controller is sufficient to,
for example, update or delete the DID document. Another DID method could
require different keys, or a different verification method entirely, to be
presented in order to update or delete the DID document than that used to
authenticate. In other words, what is done _after_ the authentication check is
out of scope for the DID data model, but DID methods and applications are
expected to define this themselves.

A DID document MAY include an `authentication` property. The `authentication`
property is an example of a verification relationship.

authentication

     The `authentication` property is a relationship between the DID subject and a set of verification methods (such as, but not limited to, public keys). It means that the DID subject has authorized some set of verification methods (per the value of the `authentication` property) for the purpose of authentication. The value of the `authentication` property SHOULD be an array of verification methods. Each verification method MAY be embedded or referenced. An example of a verification method is a public key (see Section ). 

This statement is useful to any "authentication verifier" that needs to check
to see if an entity that is attempting to authenticate is, in fact, presenting
a valid proof of authentication. When a verifier receives some data (in some
protocol-specific format) that contains a proof that was made for the purpose
of "authentication", and that says that an entity is identified by the DID,
then that verifier checks to ensure that the proof can be verified using a
verification method (e.g., public key) listed under `authentication` in the
DID Document.

The verification method indicated by the `authentication` property of a DID
document can only be used to authenticate the DID subject. To authenticate the
DID controller (in cases where the DID controller is not _also_ the DID
subject) the entity associated with the value of `controller` (see Section )
needs to authenticate itself with its _own_ DID document and attached
`authentication` verification method relationship.

Example:

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "authentication": [
        // this method can be used to authenticate as did:...fghi
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        // this method can be used to authenticate as did:...fghi
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#biometric-1",
        // this method is *only* authorized for authentication, it may not
        // be used for any other proof purpose, so its full description is
        // embedded here rather than using only a reference
        {
          "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
          "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
          "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
          "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        }
      ],
      ...
    }
          

##  Authorization and Delegation

Authorization is the mechanism used to state how operations may be performed
on behalf of the DID subject. Delegation is the mechanism that the subject
uses to authorize others to act on their behalf.

Note that Authorization is separate from . This is particularly important for
key recovery in the case of key loss, when the subject no longer has access to
their keys, or key compromise, where the DID controller's trusted third
parties need to override malicious activity by an attacker. See Section .

A DID document MAY include a `controller` property to indicate that there are
DID controller(s) other than the DID subject. If so:

controller

     The value of the `controller` property MUST be a valid DID or an array of valid DIDs. The corresponding DID document(s) SHOULD contain authorization relations that explicitly permit the use of certain verification methods for specific purposes. 

Each DID method MUST define how authorization and delegation are implemented,
including any necessary cryptographic operations.

There are at least two suggested methods for implementing Authorization and
Delegation, which may be layered:

  * A verifiable data registry could implement a coarse-grained `controller` pattern by enabling DID documents to express the DID of another DID controller that controls it, or additionally, 
  * A verifiable data registry could implement a capabilities-based approach enabling further fine-grained control of authorization and delegation. 

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "controller": "did:example:bcehfew7h32f32h7af3",
      "service": [{
        // used to retrieve Verifiable Credentials associated with the DID
        "type": "VerifiableCredentialService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/vc/"
      }]
    }
          

## Service Endpoints

Service endpoints are used in DID documents to express ways of communicating
with the DID subject or associated entities. Services listed in the DID
document can contain information about privacy preserving messaging services,
or more public information, such as social media accounts, personal websites,
and email addresses although this is discouraged. See  for additional details.
The metadata associated with services are often service-specific. For example,
the metadata associated with an encrypted messaging service can express how to
initiate the encrypted link before messaging begins.

Pointers to services are expressed using the `service` property. Each service
has its own `id` and `type`, as well as a `serviceEndpoint` with a URI or
other properties describing the service.

One of the primary purposes of a DID document is to enable discovery of
service endpoints. A service endpoint can be any type of service the DID
subject wants to advertise, including decentralized identity management
services for further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction.

A DID document MAY include a `service` property.

service

     If a DID document includes a `service` property, the value of the property SHOULD be an array of service endpoint objects. Each service endpoint MUST have `id`, `type`, and `serviceEndpoint` properties, and MAY include additional properties. 

The value of the `id` property MUST be a URI. The array of service endpoints
MUST NOT contain multiple entries with the same `id`. In this case, a DID
document processor MUST produce an error.

The value of the `serviceEndpoint` property MUST be a JSON-LD object or a
valid URI conforming to [[RFC3986]] and normalized according to the rules in
section 6 of [[RFC3986]] and to any normalization rules in its applicable URI
scheme specification.

It is expected that the service endpoint protocol is published in an open
standard specification.

    
    
    {
      "service": [{
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#openid",

        "type": "AgentService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://agent.example.com/8377464"

          "type": "UserHubEndpoint",
          "instances": ["did:example:456", "did:example:789"]
        }
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#messages",
        "type": "MessagingService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/messages/8377464"
      }, {

        "type": "SocialWebInboxService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://social.example.com/83hfh37dj",
        "description": "My public social inbox",
        "spamCost": {
          "amount": "0.50",
          "currency": "USD"
        }
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#authpush",
        "type": "DidAuthPushModeVersion1",
        "serviceEndpoint": "http://auth.example.com/did:example:123456789abcdefg"
      }]
    }
          

For more information about security considerations regarding authentication
service endpoints see Sections  and .

## Created

A DID document SHOULD include a `created` property.

created

     If a DID document includes a `created` property, the value of the property MUST be a valid XML datetime value, as defined in section 3.3.7 of [W3C XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) 1.1 Part 2: Datatypes](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/) [[XMLSCHEMA11-2]]. This datetime value MUST be normalized to UTC 00:00, as indicated by the trailing "Z". 
    
    
    {
      "created": "2002-10-10T17:00:00Z"
    }
          

## Updated

Standard metadata for identifier records includes a timestamp of the most
recent change.

A DID document SHOULD include an `updated` property.

updated

     If a DID document includes an `updated` property, the value of the property MUST follow the same formatting rules as the `created` property, as outlined in Section . 
    
    
    {
      "updated": "2016-10-17T02:41:00Z"
    }
          

# Core Representations

All concrete representations of a DID document MUST be serialized using a
deterministic mapping that is able to be unambiguously parsed into the data
model defined in this specification. All serialization methods MUST define
rules for the bidirectional translation of a DID document both into and out of
the representation in question. As a consequence, translation between any two
representations MUST be done by parsing the source format into a DID document
model (described in Sections  and ) and then serializing the DID document
model into the target representation. An implementation MUST NOT convert
between representations without first parsing to a DID document model.

Although syntactic mappings are provided for JSON, JSON-LD, and CBOR here,
applications and services MAY use any other data representation syntax that is
capable of expressing the data model, such as XML or YAML.

Producers MUST indicate which representation of a document has been used via a
media type in the document's metadata. Consumers MUST determine which
representation a document is in via the `content-type` DID resolver metadata
field. (See ). Consumers MUST NOT determine the representation of a document
through its content alone.

This requirement depends on the return of DID document metadata that still
needs to be defined by this specification. Once defined, that should be linked
from here.

The production and consumption rules in this section apply to all
implementations seeking to be fully compatible with independent
implementations of the specification. Deployments of this specification MAY
use a custom agreed-upon representation, including localized rules for
handling properties not listed in the registry. See section  for more
information.

A link to a section on extensibility and conformance as it applies to data
representations should be added here once that section has been written.

##  JSON

When producing and consuming DID documents that are in plain JSON (as
indicated by a `content-type` of `application/did+json` in the resolver
metadata), the following rules MUST be followed.

### Production

A DID document MUST be a single JSON object conforming to [[!RFC8259]]. All
top-level properties of the DID document MUST be represented by using the
property name as the name of the member of the JSON object. The values of
properties of the data model described in Section , including all extensions,
MUST be encoded in JSON [[RFC8259]] by mapping property values to JSON types
as follows:

In this section we use the term "property name" to refer to the string that
represents the property itself, but this specification still needs to define a
concrete term for such aspects of a property of a DID document.

  * Numeric values representable as IEEE754 MUST be represented as a Number type. 
  * Boolean values MUST be represented as a Boolean literal. 
  * Sequence value MUST be represented as an Array type. 
  * Unordered sets of values MUST be represented as an Array type. 
  * Sets of properties MUST be represented as an Object type. 
  * Empty values MUST be represented as a null literal. 
  * Other values MUST be represented as a String type. 

An "empty" value is not specified by this document. It seems to imply a null
value, but this is unclear.

All properties of the DID document MUST be included in the root object.
Properties MAY define additional data sub structures subject to the value
representation rules in the list above.

The member name `@context` MUST NOT be used as this property is reserved for
JSON-LD producers.

###  Consumption

In this section and we use the term "property name" to refer to the string
that represents the property itself, but this specification still needs to
define a concrete term for such aspects of a property of a DID document. We
also need a concrete term for "the document itself" as opposed to "the
collection or properties of the document".

The top-level element MUST be a JSON object. Any other data type at the top
level is an error and MUST be rejected. The top-level JSON object represents
the DID document, and all members of this object are properties of the DID
document. The object member name is the property name, and the member value is
interpreted as follows:

  * Number types MUST interpreted as numeric values representable as IEEE754. 
  * Boolean literals MUST be interpreted as a Boolean value. 
  * An Array type MUST be interpreted as a Sequence or Unordered set, depending on the definition of the property for this value. 
  * An Object type MUST be interpreted as a sets of properties. 
  * A null literal MUST be interpreted as an Empty value. 
  * String types MUST be interpreted as Strings, which may be further parsed depending on the definition of the property for this value into more specific data types such as URIs, date stamps, or other values. 

An "empty" value is not specified by this document. It seems to imply a null
value, but this is unclear.

The value of the `@context` object member MUST be ignored as this is reserved
for JSON-LD consumers.

Unknown object member names MUST be ignored as unknown properties.

This specification needs to define clear and consistent rules for how to
handle unknown data members on consumption, and this section needs to be
updated with that decision.

##  JSON-LD

[[!JSON-LD]] is a JSON-based format used to serialize [Linked
Data](http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data).

When producing and consuming DID documents that are in JSON-LD (as indicated
by a `content-type` of `application/did+ld+json` in the resolver metadata),
the following rules MUST be followed.

  * The `@id` and `@type` keywords are aliased to `id` and `type` respectively, enabling developers to use this specification as idiomatic JSON. 
  * Even though JSON-LD allows any IRI as node identifiers, DID documents are explicitly restricted to only describe DIDs. This means that the value of `id` MUST be a valid DID and not any other kind of IRI. 
  * Data types, such as integers, dates, units of measure, and URLs, are automatically typed to provide stronger type guarantees for use cases that require them. 

##  Production

The DID document is serialized following the rules in the JSON processor, with
one addition: DID documents MUST include the `@context` property.

@context

     The value of the `@context` property MUST be one or more URIs, where the value of the first URI is `https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1`. All members of the `@context` property MUST exist be in the DID properties extension registry. 

This specification defines globally interoperable documents, and the
requirement that the context value be in the verifiable data registry means
that different JSON-LD processors can consume the document without having to
dereference anything in the context field. However, a pair of producers and
consumers can have local extension agreements. This needs to be clarified in a
section on extensibility and linked here when available.

##  Consumption

The top-level element MUST be a JSON object. Any other data type at the top
level is an error and MUST be rejected. This top-level JSON object is
interpreted using JSON-LD processing under the rules of the defined `@context`
fields.

@context

     The value of the `@context` property MUST be one or more URIs, where the value of the first URI is `https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1`. If more than one URI is provided, the URIs MUST be interpreted as an ordered set. It is RECOMMENDED that dereferencing each URI results in a document containing machine-readable information about the context. 

Unknown object member names MUST be ignored as unknown properties.

This specification needs to define clear and consistent rules for how to
handle unknown data members on consumption, and this section needs to be
updated with that decision.

# Methods

## Method Schemes

A DID method specification MUST define exactly one method-specific DID scheme,
identified by exactly one method name. For more information, see the `method-
name` rule in Section .

Because the method name is part of the DID, short method names are preferred;
the method name SHOULD be five characters or less. The method name might
reflect the name of the verifiable data registry to which the DID method
specification applies. For more information, see Section .

The DID method specification for the method-specific DID scheme MUST specify
how to generate the `method-specific-id` component of a DID. The `method-
specific-id` value MUST be able to be generated without the use of a
centralized registry service. The `method-specific-id` value SHOULD be
globally unique by itself. The DID, as defined by the `did` rule in Section ,
MUST be globally unique.

If needed, a method-specific DID scheme MAY define multiple `method-specific-
id` formats. It is RECOMMENDED that a method-specific DID scheme define as few
`method-specific-id` formats as possible.

The `method-specific-id` format MAY include colons, which might be used by DID
methods for various purposes, such as establishing hierarchically partitioned
namespaces, or identifying specific instances or parts of the verifiable data
registry. The use of colons MUST comply syntactically with the `method-
specific-id` ABNF rule and their use is entirely method-specific. Implementers
are advised to avoid assuming any meanings or behaviors associated with a
colon that are generically applicable to all DID methods.

The authors of a new DID method specification SHOULD use a method name that is
unique among all DID method names known to them at the time of publication.

Because there is no central authority for allocating or approving DID method
names, there is no way to know for certain if a specific DID method name is
unique. To help with this challenge, a non-authoritative list of known DID
method names and their associated specifications is maintained in the DID
Methods Registry, which is part of [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

The DID Methods Registry is a tool for implementors to use when coming to
consensus on a new method name, as well as an informative reference for
software developers implementing DID resolvers for different DID methods. For
more information about DID resolvers see Section . The DID Method Registry is
not a definitive or official list of DID methods. Nonetheless, adding DID
method names to the DID Method Registry is encouraged so that other
implementors and members of the community have a place to see an overview of
existing DID methods. The lightweight criteria for inclusion are documented in
[[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

## Method Operations

To enable the full functionality of DIDs and DID documents on a particular
verifiable data registry, a DID method specification MUST specify how a client
might be used to perform the create, read, update, and deactivate operations.
Each operation ought to be specified to the level of detail necessary to build
and test interoperable client implementations. In the event that an operation
is not supported, such as update or deactivate, then it is RECOMMENDED that
the DID Method specification state that it is not supported. These operations
can be used to perform all the operations required of a cryptographic key
management system (CKMS), e.g.: key registration, key replacement, key
rotation, key recovery, and key expiration.

Determining the authority of a party to carry out the operations is method-
specific. For example, a DID method MAY:

  * use the verification methods listed under authentication to decide whether an update/deactivate operation is allowed; or 
  * use other constructs in the DID Document to decide this, for example, a verification method specified under capabilityInvocation could be used to verify the invocation of a capability to update the DID Document.; or 
  * not use the DID Document at all to decide this, but have rules that are "built into" the method. 

###  Create

The DID method specification MUST specify how a client creates a DID and its
associated DID document on the verifiable data registry, including all
cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of control.

###  Read/Verify

The DID method specification MUST specify how a client uses a DID to request a
DID document from the verifiable data registry, including how the client can
verify the authenticity of the response.

###  Update

The DID method specification MUST specify how a client can update a DID
document on the verifiable data registry, including all cryptographic
operations necessary to establish proof of control, _or_ state that updates
are not possible.

An update to a DID is any change, after creation, in the data used to produce
a DID document. DID Method implementers are responsible for defining what
constitutes an update, and what properties of the DID document are supported
by a given DID method. For example, an update operation which replaces key
material without changing it could be a valid update that does not result in
changes to the DID document.

###  Deactivate

The DID method specification MUST specify how a client can deactivate a DID on
the verifiable data registry, including all cryptographic operations necessary
to establish proof of deactivation, _or_ state that deactivation is not
possible.

##  Interoperability

Interoperability for DID methods will be determined by evaluating each DID
method specification to determine, at a minimum, that the:

  * DID method name is unique and not used by an existing, incompatible DID method. 
  * Required operations are supported. 
  * Operations requiring descriptions are described. 
  * Specification is specific, detailed, and complete enough for independent implementation. 
  * Specification contains sections describing security and privacy considerations. 

## Extensibility

##  Security Requirements

DID method specifications MUST include their own Security Considerations
sections. This section MUST consider all the requirements mentioned in section
5 of [[RFC3552]] (page 27) for the DID operations defined in the
specification.

At least the following forms of attack MUST be considered: eavesdropping,
replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle.
Potential denial of service attacks MUST be identified as well.

If the protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, the DID
method specification MUST clearly indicate which portions of the data are
protected and what the protections are, and SHOULD give an indication to what
sorts of attacks the cryptographic protection is susceptible. For example,
integrity only, confidentiality, endpoint authentication, and so on.

Data which is to be held secret (keying material, random seeds, and so on)
SHOULD be clearly labeled.

If the technology involves authentication, particularly user-host
authentication, the security of the authentication method MUST be clearly
specified.

This section MUST discuss, per Section 5 of [[RFC3552]], residual risks (such
as the risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation,
or cipher) after threat mitigation was deployed.

This section MUST provide integrity protection and update authentication for
all operations required by Section .

Where DID methods make use of peer-to-peer computing resources, such as with
all known DLTs, the expected burdens of those resources SHOULD be discussed in
relation to denial of service.

Method-specific endpoint authentication MUST be discussed. Where DID methods
make use of DLTs with varying network topology, sometimes offered as _light
node_ or _[thin client](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security)_
implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security
assumptions of the topology available to implementations of the DID method
MUST be discussed.

DID methods MUST discuss the policy mechanism by which DIDs are proven to be
uniquely assigned. A DID fits the functional definition of a URN, as defined
in [[RFC8141]]. That is, a DID is a persistent identifier that is assigned
once to a resource and never reassigned to a different resource. This is
particularly important in a security context because a DID might be used to
identify a specific party subject to a specific set of authorization rights.

DID methods that introduce new authentication service endpoint types (see
Section ) SHOULD consider the security requirements of the supported
authentication protocol.

##  Privacy Requirements

DID method specifications MUST include their own Privacy Considerations
sections, if only to point to .

The DID method specification's Privacy Considerations section MUST discuss any
subsection of section 5 of [[RFC6973]] that could apply in a method-specific
manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored data compromise,
unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation, identification, secondary
use, disclosure, exclusion.

#  Resolution

This section defines the inputs and outputs of the DID resolution and DID URL
dereferencing processes. The exact implementation of these functions is out of
scope for this specification, but some considerations for implementors are
available in [[?DID-RESOLUTION]].

##  DID Resolution

##  DID URL Dereferencing

##  Metadata Structure

#  Security Considerations

During the Working Draft stage, this section focuses on security topics that
should be important in early implementations. The editors are seeking feedback
on threats and threat mitigations that should be reflected in this section or
elsewhere in the spec. DIDs are designed to operate under the general Internet
threat model used by many IETF standards. We assume uncompromised endpoints,
but anticipate that messages could be read or corrupted on the network.
Protecting against an attack when a system is compromised requires external
key-signing hardware (see Section ).

##  Choosing DID Resolvers

The DID Method Registry (see [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]] is an informative list
of DID method names and their corresponding DID method specifications.
Implementors need to bear in mind that there is no central authority to
mandate which DID method specification is to be used with any specific DID
method name, but can use the DID Method Registry to make an informed decision
when choosing which DID resolver implementations to use.

##  Binding of Identity

The following sections describe binding identities to DIDs and DID documents.

###  Proving Control of a DID and DID Document

Signatures are one way to allow DID documents to be cryptographically
verifiable.

By itself, a verified signature on a self-signed DID document does not prove
control of a DID. It only proves that the:

  * DID document was not tampered with since it was registered. 
  * DID controller(s) controlled the private key used for the signature at the time the signature was generated. 

Proving control of a DID, that is, the binding between the DID and the DID
document that describes it, requires a two step process:

  1. Resolving the DID to a DID document according to its DID method specification. 
  2. Verifying that the `id` property of the resulting DID document matches the DID that was resolved. 

It should be noted that this process proves control of a DID and DID document
regardless of whether the DID document is signed.

Signatures on DID documents are optional. DID method specifications SHOULD
explain and specify their implementation if applicable.

It is good practice to combine timestamps with signatures.

###  Proving Control of a Public Key

There are two methods for proving control of the private key corresponding to
a public key description in the DID document: static and dynamic.

The static method is to sign the DID document with the private key. This
proves control of the private key at a time no later than the DID document was
registered. If the DID document is not signed, control of a public key
described in the DID document can still be proven dynamically as follows:

  1. Send a challenge message containing a public key description from the DID document and a nonce to an appropriate service endpoint described in the DID document. 
  2. Verify the signature of the response message against the public key description. 

###  Authentication and Verifiable Claims

A DID and DID document do not inherently carry any [
PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information)
(personally-identifiable information). The process of binding a DID to
something in the real world, such as a person or a company, for example with
credentials with the same subject as that DID, is out of scope for this
specification. For more information, see the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] instead.

##  Authentication Service Endpoints

If a DID document publishes a service endpoint intended for authentication or
authorization of the DID subject (see Section ), it is the responsibility of
the service endpoint provider, subject, or relying party to comply with the
requirements of the authentication protocols supported at that service
endpoint.

##  Non-Repudiation

Non-repudiation of DIDs and DID document updates is supported under the
assumption that the subject:

  * Is monitoring for unauthorized updates (see Section ). 
  * Has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious updates according to the access control mechanism for the DID method (see Section ). 

Non-repudiation is further supported if timestamps are included (see Sections
and ) and the target DLT system supports timestamps.

##  Notification of DID Document Changes

One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a DID document is monitoring
and actively notifying the DID subject when there are changes. This is
analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to the
email addresses on file.

In the case of a DID, there is no intermediary registrar or account provider
to generate such notifications. However, if the verifiable data registry on
which the DID is registered directly supports change notifications, a
subscription service can be offered to DID controllers. Notifications could be
sent directly to the relevant service endpoints listed in an existing DID.

If a DID controller chooses to rely on a third-party monitoring service (other
than the verifiable data registry itself), this introduces another vector of
attack.

##  Key and Signature Expiration

In a decentralized identifier architecture, there are no centralized
authorities to enforce key or signature expiration policies. Therefore DID
resolvers and other client applications need to validate that keys were not
expired at the time they were used. Because some use cases might have
legitimate reasons why already-expired keys can be extended, make sure a key
expiration does not prevent any further use of the key, and implementations of
a resolver ought to be compatible with such extension behavior.

##  Key Revocation and Recovery

Section  specifies the DID operations to be supported by a DID method
specification, including deactivation of a DID document by replacing it with
an updated DID document. It is also up to the DID method to define how
revocation of cryptographic keys might occur. Additionally, DID method
specifications are also expected to enable support for a quorum of trusted
parties to enable key recovery. Some of the facilities to do so are suggested
in Section . Not all DID method specifications will recognize control from
DIDs registered using other DID methods and they might restrict third-party
control to DIDs that use the same method. Access control and key recovery in a
DID method specification can also include a time lock feature to protect
against key compromise by maintaining a second track of control for recovery.
Further specification of this type of control is a matter for future work (see
Section ).

##  The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers

DIDs achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central registration
authority. This comes, however, at the cost of human memorability. The
algorithms capable of generating globally unique identifiers automatically
produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This
demonstrates the axiom about identifiers described in [Zooko's
Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle): "human-
meaningful, decentralized, secure -- pick any two".

There are of course many use cases where it is desirable to discover a DID
when starting from a human-friendly identifier. For example, a natural
language name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a DID controller,
such as a mobile telephone number, email address, Twitter handle, or blog URL.
However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to DIDs (and doing
so in a way that can be verified and trusted) is outside the scope of this
specification.

Solutions to this problem (and there are many) should be defined in separate
specifications that reference this specification. It is strongly recommended
that such specifications carefully consider the:

  * Numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly identifier for a target entity. 
  * Privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently correlatable, especially if they are globally unique. 

A draft specification for discovering a DID from domain names and email
addresses using DNS lookups is available at [[?DNS-DID]].

##  Immutability

Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and the
assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Like any ecosystem, the DID
ecosystem has some potential for this to occur. Because this specification is
focused on a data model instead of a protocol, it offers no opinion about many
aspects of how that model is put to use. However, individual DID methods might
want to consider constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics they
do not need. The more _locked down_ a DID method is, while providing the same
set of features, the less it can be manipulated by malicious actors.

As an example, consider the flexibility that the data model offers with
respect to updating. A single edit to a DID document can change anything and
everything except the root `id` property of the document. And any individual
JSON object in the data model can change all of its properties except its
`id`. But is it actually desirable for a service endpoint to change its `type`
after it is defined? Or for a key to change its value? Or would it be better
to require a new `id` when certain fundamental properties of an object change?
Malicious takeovers of a web site often aim for an outcome where the site
keeps its identifier (the host name), but gets subtle, dangerous changes
underneath. If certain properties of the site were required by the
specification to be immutable (for example, the
[ASN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_\(Internet\)) associated
with its IP address), such attacks might be much harder and more expensive to
carry out, and anomaly detection would be easier.

The notion that immutability provides some cybersecurity benefits is
particularly relevant because of caching. For DID methods tied to a global
source of truth, a direct, just-in-time lookup of the latest version of a DID
document is always possible. However, it seems likely that layers of cache
might eventually sit between a client and that source of truth. If they do,
believing the attributes of an object in the DID document to have a given
state, when they are actually subtly different, might invite exploits. This is
particularly true if some lookups are of a full DID document, and others are
of partial data, where the larger context is assumed.

##  Encrypted Data in DID Documents

DID documents are typically publicly available. Encryption algorithms have
been known to fail due to advances in cryptography and computing power.
Implementers are advised to assume that any encrypted data placed in a DID
document might eventually be made available in clear text to the same audience
to which the encrypted data is available.

Encrypting all or parts of DID documents is _not_ an appropriate means to
protect data in the long term. Similarly, placing encrypted data in DID
documents is not an appropriate means to include personally identifiable
information.

Given the caveats above, if encrypted data is included in a DID document,
implementers are advised to not encrypt with the public keys of entities that
do not wish to be correlated with the DID.

#  Privacy Considerations

It is critically important to apply the principles of Privacy by Design to all
aspects of the decentralized identifier architecture, because DIDs and DID
documents are, by design, administered directly by the DID controller(s).
There is no registrar, hosting company, or other intermediate service provider
to recommend or apply additional privacy safeguards. The authors of this
specification have applied all seven Privacy by Design principles throughout
its development. For example, privacy in this specification is preventative
not remedial, and privacy is an embedded default. Furthermore, the
decentralized identifier architecture by itself embodies principle #7,
"Respect for user privacy -- keep it user-centric."

This section lists additional privacy considerations that implementers,
delegates, and DID subjects should keep in mind.

##  Keep Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) Private

If a DID method specification is written for a public DID registry where all
DIDs and DID documents are publicly available, it is _critical_ that DID
documents contain no personal data. All personal data should be kept behind
service endpoints under the control of the DID subject. Additional due
diligence should be taken around the use of URLs in service endpoints as well
to prevent leakage of unintentional personal data or correlation within a URL
of a service endpoint. For example, a URL that contains a username is likely
dangerous to include in a DID Document because the username is likely to be
human-meaningful in a way that can unintentionally reveal information that the
DID subject did not consent to sharing. With this privacy architecture,
personal data can be exchanged on a private, peer-to-peer basis using
communications channels identified and secured by public key descriptions in
DID documents. This also enables DID subjects and relying parties to implement
the [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)
[right to be forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten),
because no personal data is written to an immutable distributed ledger.

##  DID Correlation Risks and Pseudonymous DIDs

Like any type of globally unique identifier, DIDs might be used for
correlation. DID controllers can mitigate this privacy risk by using pairwise
unique DIDs, that is, sharing a different private DID for every relationship.
In effect, each DID acts as a pseudonym. A pseudonymous DID need only be
shared with more than one party when the DID subject explicitly authorizes
correlation between those parties. If pseudonymous DIDs are the default, then
the only need for a public DID (a DID published openly or shared with a large
number of parties) is when the DID subject explicitly desires public
identification.

##  DID Document Correlation Risks

The anti-correlation protections of pseudonymous DIDs are easily defeated if
the data in the corresponding DID documents can be correlated. For example,
using same public key descriptions or bespoke service endpoints in multiple
DID documents can provide as much correlation information as using the same
DID. Therefore the DID document for a pseudonymous DID also needs to use
pairwise unique public keys. It might seem natural to also use pairwise unique
service endpoints in the DID document for a pseudonymous DID. However, unique
endpoints allow all traffic between two DIDs to be isolated perfectly into
unique buckets, where timing correlation and similar analysis is easy.
Therefore, a better strategy for endpoint privacy might be to share an
endpoint among thousands or millions of DIDs controlled by many different
subjects.

##  Herd Privacy

When a DID subject is indistinguishable from others in the herd, privacy is
available. When the act of engaging privately with another party is by itself
a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished. DIDs and DID methods need
to work to improve herd privacy, particularly for those who legitimately need
it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces that default to preserving
anonymity and pseudonymity. To reduce [ digital
fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint), share common
settings across client implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum
on wire protocols, use encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to
standard lengths.

#  Future Work

##  Upper Limits on DID Character Length

The current specification does not take a position on maximum length of a DID.
The maximum interoperable URL length is currently about 2K characters. QR
codes can handle about 4K characters. Clients using DIDs will be responsible
for storing many DIDs, and some methods would be able to externalize some of
their costs onto clients by relying on more complicated signature schemes or
by adding state into DIDs intended for temporary use. A future version of this
specification should set reasonable limits on DID character length to minimize
externalities.

##  Equivalence

Including an equivalence property, such as `equivID`, in DID documents whose
value is an array of DIDs would allow subjects to assert two or more DIDs that
represent the same subject. This capability has numerous uses, including
supporting migration between DID registries and providing forward
compatibility of existing DIDs to future DID registries. In theory, equivalent
DIDs should have the same identifier rights, allowing [verifiable
claims](https://w3c.github.io/vctf/) made against one DID to apply to
equivalent DIDs. Equivalence was not included in the current specification due
to the complexity of verifying equivalence across different DLTs and different
DID methods, and also of aggregating properties of equivalent DID documents.
However equivalence should be supported in a future version of this
specification.

##  Verifiable Timestamps

Verifiable timestamps have significant utility for identifier records. This is
a good fit for DLTs, since most offer some type of timestamp mechanism.
Despite some transactional cost, they are the among the most censorship-
resistant transaction ordering systems at the present, so they are nearly
ideal for DID document timestamping. In some cases a DLT's immediate timing is
approximate, however their sense of [ "median time past" (see Bitcoin BIP
113)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki%23Abstract)
can be precisely defined. A generic DID document timestamping mechanism could
would work across all DLTs and might operate via a mechanism including either
individual transactions or transaction batches. The generic mechanism was
deemed out of scope for this version, although it may be included in a future
version of this specification.

##  Time Locks and DID Document Recovery

Section  mentions one possible clever use of time locks to recover control of
a DID after a key compromise. The technique relies on an ability to override
the most recent update to a DID document with Authorization applied by an
earlier version of the DID document in order to defeat the attacker. This
protection depends on adding a [ time lock (see Bitcoin BIP
65)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki%23Abstract)
to protect part of the transaction chain, enabling a Authorization block to be
used to recover control. We plan to add support for time locks in a future
version of this specification.

##  Smart Signatures

Not all DLTs can support the Authorization logic in section . Therefore, in
this version of the specification, all Authorization logic is delegated to DID
method specifications. A potential future solution is a [Smart
Signature](http://www.weboftrust.info/downloads/smart-signatures.pdf)
specification that specifies the code any conformant DLT may implement to
process signature control logic.

##  Verifiable Credentials

Although DIDs and DID documents form a foundation for decentralized identity,
they are only the first step in describing their subjects. The rest of the
descriptive power comes through collecting and selectively using Verifiable
Credentials [[VC-DATA-MODEL]]. Future versions of the specification will
describe in more detail how DIDs and DID document can be integrated with --
and help enable -- the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem.

##  Alternate Serializations and Graph Models

This version of the specification relies on JSON-LD and the RDF graph model
for expressing a DID document. Future versions of this specification might
specify other semantic graph formats for a DID document.
