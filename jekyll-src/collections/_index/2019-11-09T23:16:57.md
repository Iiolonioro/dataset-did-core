Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable,
decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers are designed to enable
the controller of a DID to prove control over it and to be implemented
independently of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate
authority. DIDs are URLs that relate a DID subject to means for trustable
interactions with that subject by way of a DID document. DID documents are
simple documents that describe how to use that specific DID. Each DID document
may express cryptographic material, verification methods, and/or service
endpoints. These provide a set of mechanisms which enable a DID controller to
prove control of the DID. Service endpoints enable trusted interactions with
the DID subject.

This document specifies a common data model, a URL format, and a set of
operations for DIDs, DID documents, and DID methods.

This specification is under active development and implementers are advised
against implementing the specification unless they are directly involved with
the W3C DID Working Group. There are use cases [[?DID-USE-CASES]] in active
development that establish requirements for this document.

At present, there exist [40 experimental
implementations](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/#the-registry)
and a preliminary [test suite](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-test-suite/)
that will eventually determine whether or not implementations are conformant.
Readers are advised that Appendix  contains a list of concerns and proposed
changes that will most likely result in alterations to this specification.

#  Introduction

Conventional [identity
management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) systems are
based on centralized authorities such as corporate [directory
services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_service), [certificate
authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority), or [domain
name registries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry). From the
standpoint of cryptographic trust verification, each of these centralized
authorities serves as its own [root of
trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_anchor). To make identity
management work across these systems requires implementing [federated identity
management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity).

The emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT), sometimes referred to as
blockchain technology, provides the opportunity for fully decentralized
identity management. In a decentralized identity system, entities (in the
sense of discrete identifiable units such as -- but not limited to -- people,
organizations, and things) are free to use any shared root of trust. Globally
distributed ledgers, decentralized P2P networks, or other systems with similar
capabilities, provide the means for managing a root of trust without
introducing a centralized authority or a single point of failure. In
combination, DLTs and decentralized identity management systems enable any
entity to create and manage their own identifiers on any number of
distributed, independent roots of trust.

Entities are identified by decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and may
authenticate via proofs (e.g., digital signatures, privacy-preserving
biometric protocols, etc.). DIDs point to DID documents. A DID document
contains a set of service endpoints for interacting with the entity the DID
identifies (aka the DID subject). Following the dictums of [Privacy by
Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design), any entity may have
as many DIDs as necessary (and corresponding DID documents and service
endpoints), to respect the entityâ€™s desired separation of identities,
personas, and contexts (in the everyday sense of these words).

DID methods are the mechanism by which a DID and its associated DID document
are created, read, updated, and deactivated on a specific distributed ledger
or network. DID methods are defined using separate DID method specifications.

This design eliminates dependence on centralized registries for identifiers as
well as centralized certificate authorities for key management -- the standard
pattern in hierarchical [PKI (public key
infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure)). In
cases where the DID registry is a distributed ledger, each entity may serve as
its own root authority -- an architecture referred to as [DPKI (decentralized
PKI)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-
trust/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf).

Note that DID methods may also be developed for identifiers registered in
federated or centralized identity management systems. For their part, all
types of identifier systems may add support for DIDs. This creates an
interoperability bridge between the worlds of centralized, federated, and
decentralized identifiers.

The first purpose of this specification is to define the generic DID scheme
and a generic set of operations on DID documents that can be implemented for
any DID registry. The second purpose of this specification is to define the
conformance requirements for a DID method specification -- a separate
specification that defines a specific DID scheme and specific set of DID
document operations for a specific DID registry.

Conceptually, the relationship of this specification and a DID method
specification is similar to the relationship of the IETF generic URI
specification ([[RFC3986]]) and a specific URI scheme ([[IANA-URI-SCHEMES]]
(such as the http: and https: schemes specified in [[RFC7230]]). It is also
similar to the relationship of the IETF generic URN specification
([[RFC8141]]) and a specific URN namespace definition (such as the UUID URN
namespace defined in [[RFC4122]]). The difference is that a DID method
specification, in addition to defining a specific DID scheme, also specifies
the methods for resolving and deactivating DIDs on, and writing DID documents
to, the appropriate DID registry.

The hierarchical design of a generic DID specification with specific DID
method specifications introduces some of the same concepts as the URI
specification:

  * DIDs from different DID methods may not be interoperable, just as URIs from different URI schemes may not be interoperable. 
  * Entities may need multiple DIDs to support different relationships, as the other party may only support certain DID methods, just as some browsers may only support certain URI schemes. 
  * Entities may need multiple DIDs to support the different cryptographic schemes of different DID methods, as not all parties will support the same cryptographic schemes, just as not all browsers support the same URI schemes. 
  * Managing multiple DIDs, and tracking which DID belongs to which relationship, under which cryptographic scheme, introduces similar logistical challenges as managing multiple web addresses and tracking which address belongs to which website, or tracking which email address belongs to which relationship. 

For a list of DID methods and their corresponding specifications, see the DID
Method Registry [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]].

##  A Simple Example

A DID is a simple text string that consists of three parts: 1) the URL scheme
identifier (`did`), 2) the identifier for the DID method, and 3) the DID
method-specific identifier.

    
    
    did:example:123456789abcdefghi
        

The DID above resolves to a DID document. A DID document contains information
associated with the DID such as ways to cryptographically authenticate the
entity in control of the DID, as well as services that can be used to interact
with the entity.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "authentication": [{
        // used to authenticate as did:...fghi
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        "type": "RsaVerificationKey2018",
        "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
      }],
      "service": [{
        // used to retrieve Verifiable Credentials associated with the DID
        "id":"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vcs",
        "type": "VerifiableCredentialService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/vc/"
      }]
    }
          

##  Design Goals

Decentralized Identifiers are a component of larger systems, such as the
Verifiable Credentials ecosystem [[?VC-DATA-MODEL]], which have driven the
design goals for this specification. This section summarizes the primary
design goals for this specification.

Goal  |  Description  
---|---  
Decentralization  |  Eliminate the requirement for centralized authorities or
single points of failure in identifier management, including the registration
of globally unique identifiers, public verification keys, service endpoints,
and other metadata.  
Control  |  Give entities, both human and non-human, the power to directly
control their digital identifiers without the need to rely on external
authorities.  
Privacy  |  Enable entities to control the privacy of their information,
including minimal, selective, and progressive disclosure of attributes or
other data.  
Security  |  Enable sufficient security for relying parties to depend on DID
documents for their required level of assurance.  
Proof-based  |  Enable the DID subject to provide cryptographic proof when
interacting with other entities.  
Discoverability  |  Make it possible for entities to discover DIDs for other
entities to learn more about or interact with those entities.  
Interoperability  |  Use interoperable standards so DID infrastructure can
make use of existing tools and software libraries designed for
interoperability.  
Portability  |  Be system and network-independent and enable entities to use
their digital identifiers with any system that supports DIDs and DID methods.  
Simplicity  |  Favor a reduced set of simple features in order to make the
technology easier to understand, implement, and deploy.  
Extensibility  |  When possible, enable extensibility provided it does not
greatly hinder interoperability, portability, or simplicity.  
  
### Interoperability

Interoperability of implementations for DIDs and DID documents will be tested
by evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse DIDs and DID
documents that conform to the specification. Interoperability for DID methods
will be determined by evaluating each DID method's specification to determine,
at a minimum,

  1. the DID method name is unique and not used by an existing, incompatible DID method, 
  2. the required operations are supported,
  3. operations requiring descriptions are described,
  4. the specification is specific, detailed, and complete enough for independent implementation, and
  5. the specification contains sections describing security and privacy considerations.

Interoperability for producers and consumers of DIDs and DID documents is
provided by ensuring the DIDs and DID documents conform. Interoperability for
method specifications is provided by the details in each method specification.
It is understood that, just like a web browser is not required to implement
all known URI schemes, conformant software that works with DIDs is not
required to implement all known DID methods. However, all implementations of a
given DID method must be interoperable for that method.

#  Terminology

#  Data Model

This section outlines the decentralized identifier data model concepts, in
particular how keys, services, and the DID subject are related to the DID
document.

For information about how the data model can be extended, see .

##  Identifier

Identifiers are used in the data model to identify specific instances of
people, organizations, devices, keys, services, and things in general.
Identifiers are typically URLs, or more generally, URIs. Non-URI based
identifiers are not advised as, while the data model supports them, they tend
to not be easy to use with other Internet-based identifiers.

##  DID Document

A DID document is the resource that is associated with a decentralized
identifier (DID). The DID document typically expresses verification methods
(such as public keys) and services that can be used to interact with a DID
controller.

A DID document is serialized according to a particular syntax (see ). The DID
itself is contained in the `id` property.

The properties that can be present in a DID document are detailed further in .

The properties present in a DID document can be updated according to the
applicable .

##  Cryptographic Keys and Other Verification Methods

A DID document can express cryptographic keys and other verification methods
that can be used to authenticate or authorize interactions with the DID
subject or associated parties. The information expressed often includes
globally unambiguous identifiers and public key material which can be used to
verify digital signatures. Other information can be expressed such as status
information for the key, such as if it has been suspended or revoked, or other
attributes that enable one to determine whether it is a hardware-backed
cryptographic key.

With respect to cryptographic key material,  can be included in a DID document
using, for example, the `publicKey` or `authentication` properties depending
on what they are to be used for. Each public key has an identifier (`id`) of
its own, a `type`, and a `controller`, as well as other properties which
depend on what type of key it is.

##  Services

Service endpoints are used in DID documents to express ways in which one can
communicate with the DID subject or associated entities. Services listed in
the DID document can contain information about privacy preserving messaging
services, or more public information such as social media accounts, personal
websites, and email addresses. The metadata associated with services are often
service specific. For example, the metadata associated with an encrypted
messaging service can express how to initiate the encrypted link before
messaging begins.

Pointers to services are expressed using the `service` property. Each service
has its own `id` and `type`, as well as a `serviceEndpoint` with a URI or
further properties describing the service.

For more information see .

#  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

The concept of a globally unique decentralized identifier is not new;
Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) were first developed in the 1980s and
later became a standard feature of the Open Software Foundationâ€™s [Distributed
Computing
Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Computing_Environment).
UUIDs achieve global uniqueness without a centralized registry service by
using an algorithm that generates 128-bit values with sufficient entropy that
the chance of collision are infinitesimally small. UUIDs are formally
specified in [[RFC4122]] as a specific type of Unified Resource Name (URN).

A DID is similar to a UUID except: (a) like a URL, it can be resolved or
dereferenced to a standard resource describing the subject (a DID document --
see Section ), and (b) unlike a URL, the DID document typically contains
cryptographic material that enables authentication of the DID subject.

##  Generic DID Syntax

The generic DID scheme is a URI scheme conformant with [[!RFC3986]]. The DID
scheme specializes only the scheme and authority components of a DID URL --
the `path-abempty`, `query`, and `fragment` components are identical to the
ABNF rules defined in [[!RFC3986]].

The term DID refers only to the URI conforming to the `did` rule in the ABNF
below. A DID always identifies the DID subject. The term DID URL, defined by
the `did-url` rule, refers to a URL that begins with a DID followed by one or
more additional components. A DID URL always identifies the resource to be
located.

The following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [[!RFC5234]] which
defines `ALPHA` and `DIGIT`. All other rule names not defined in this ABNF are
defined in [[RFC3986]].

    
    
    did                = "did:" method-name ":" method-specific-id
    method-name        = 1*method-char
    method-char        = %x61-7A / DIGIT
    method-specific-id = *idchar *( ":" *idchar )
    idchar             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_"
    did-url            = did *( ";" param ) path-abempty [ "?" query ]
                         [ "#" fragment ]
    param              = param-name [ "=" param-value ]
    param-name         = 1*param-char
    param-value        = *param-char
    param-char         = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_" / ":" /
                         pct-encoded
    

The grammar currently allows an empty `method-specific-id`, e.g.,
`did:example:` would be a valid DID that could identify the DID method itself.

##  Method-Specific Syntax

A DID method specification MUST further restrict the generic DID syntax by
defining its own `method-name` and its own `method-specific-id` syntax. See
Section .

##  Generic DID Parameter Names

DID URL syntax supports a simple, generalized format for parameters based on
the matrix parameter syntax ([[MATRIX-URIS]]). The ABNF above does not specify
any parameter names (the `param-name` rule).

Some generic DID parameter names (e.g., for service selection) are completely
independent of any specific DID method and MUST always function the same way
for all DIDs. Others (e.g., for versioning) MAY be supported by certain DID
methods, but MUST operate uniformly across those DID methods that do support
them.

Parameter names that are completely method-specific are covered in .

The following table defines a set of generic DID parameter names:

Generic DID Parameter Name | Description  
---|---  
`hl` |  A resource hash of the DID document to add integrity protection, as
specified in [[HASHLINK]].  
`service` |  Identifies a service from the DID document by service ID.  
`version-id` |  Identifies a specific version of a DID document to be resolved
(the version ID could be sequential, or a UUID, or method-specific). Note:
This parameter may not be supported by all DID methods.  
`version-time` |  Identifies a certain version timestamp of a DID document to
be resolved (i.e., the DID document that was valid for a DID at a certain
time). Note: This parameter may not be supported by all DID methods.  
  
The exact processing rules for these parameters are specified in [[DID-
RESOLUTION]].

Note that there may be additional parameters or options that are not part of
the DID URL but instead passed to a DID resolver "out of band", i.e., using a
resolution protocol or some other mechanism. Such options could for example
control caching or the desired format of a resolution result. This is similar
to HTTP, where caching or result format are expressed as HTTP headers rather
than as part of an HTTP URL. The important distinction is that DID parameters
that are part of the DID URL specify what resource is being identified,
whereas DID resolver options that are not part of the DID URL control how that
resource is dereferenced.

##  Method-Specific DID Parameter Names

A DID method specification MAY specify additional method-specific parameter
names. A method-specific parameter name MUST be prefixed by the method name as
defined by the `method-name` rule.

For example, if the method `did:foo:` defines the parameter bar, the parameter
name must be `foo:bar`. An example DID URL using this method and this method-
specific parameter would be:

`did:foo:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;foo:bar=high`

Consider using kebab-case style instead of colon separator, e.g., `foo-bar`
instead of `foo:bar`.

A method-specific parameter name defined by one DID method MAY be used by
other DID methods. For example:

`did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;foo:bar=low`

Method-specific parameter names MAY be combined with generic parameter names
in any order.

`did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;service=agent;foo:bar=high`

Both DID method namespaces and method-specific parameter namespaces MAY
include colons, so they may be partitioned hierarchically as defined by a DID
method specification. Here is an example DID URL that illustrates both:

`did:foo:baz:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;foo:baz:hex=b612`

Review what exactly we want to say about method-specific parameters defined by
one method but used in a DID URL with a different method. Also discuss
hierarchical method namespaces in DID parameter names.

##  Path

A generic DID path is identical to a URI path and MUST conform to the `path-
abempty` ABNF rule in [[!RFC3986]]. A DID path SHOULD be used to address
resources available via a service endpoint. See Section .

A specific DID scheme MAY specify ABNF rules for DID paths that are more
restrictive than the generic rules in this section.

    
    
    did:example:123456/path
          

##  Query

A generic DID query is identical to a URI query and MUST conform to the
`query` ABNF rule in [[!RFC3986]]. A DID query SHOULD be used to address
resources available via a service endpoint. See Section .

A specific DID scheme MAY specify ABNF rules for DID queries that are more
restrictive than the generic rules in this section.

    
    
    did:example:123456?query=true
          

##  Fragment

A generic DID fragment is identical to a URI fragment and MUST conform to the
`fragment` ABNF rule in [[RFC3986]]. Implementers are strongly discouraged
from using a DID fragment for anything other than a method-independent
reference into the DID document to identify a component of a DID document
(e.g., a unique public key description or service endpoint). To resolve this
reference, the complete DID URL including the DID fragment MUST be used as
input to the DID URL dereferencing algorithm (see [[DID-RESOLUTION]]) for the
target component in the DID document object.

A specific DID scheme MAY specify ABNF rules for DID fragments that are more
restrictive than the generic rules in this section.

Implementations need not rely on graph-based processing of DID documents to
locate metadata contained in the DID document when the DID includes a DID
fragment. Tree-based processing can be used instead.

Implementations SHOULD NOT prevent the use of JSON Pointer ([[!RFC6901]]).

    
    
    did:example:123456#oidc
          

##  Normalization

For the broadest interoperability, DID normalization should be as simple and
universal as possible. Therefore:

  1. The did: scheme name MUST be lowercase. 
  2. The method name MUST be lowercase. 
  3. Case sensitivity and normalization of the value of the `method-specific-id` rule in Section  MUST be defined by the governing DID method specification. 

##  Persistence

A DID is expected to be persistent and immutable, i.e., bound exclusively and
permanently to its one and only subject. Even after a DID has been
deactivated, it is intended that it never be repurposed.

Ideally a DID would be a completely abstract decentralized identifier (like a
UUID) that could be bound to multiple underlying DID registries over time,
thus maintaining its persistence independent of any particular system. However
registering the same identifier on multiple DID registries introduces
extremely hard entityship and [start-of-
authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types%23SOA) (SOA)
problems. It also greatly increases implementation complexity for developers.

To avoid these issues, it is RECOMMENDED that DID method specifications only
produce DIDs and DID methods bound to strong, stable DID registries capable of
making the highest level of commitment to persistence of the DID and DID
method over time.

Although not included in this version, future versions of this specification
may support a DID document `equivID` property to establish verifiable
equivalence relations between DIDs representing the same subject on multiple
DID registries. Such equivalence relations can produce the practical
equivalent of a single persistent abstract DID. See Future Work (Section ).

#  DID Documents

A DID points to a DID document. DID documents are the serialization of the .
The following sections define the properties of the DID document, including
whether these properties are required or optional.

## Contexts

When two software systems need to exchange data, they must use terminology and
a protocol that both systems understand. As an analogy, consider how two
people communicate. Both people must use the same language and the words they
use must mean the same thing to each other. This specification uses the
`@context` property to express the context of a conversation.

@context

     The value of the `@context` property MUST be one or more URIs, where the value of the first URI is `https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1`. If more than one URI is provided, the URIs MUST be interpreted as an ordered set. It is RECOMMENDED that dereferencing the URIs results in a document containing machine-readable information about the context. 

DID documents MUST include the `@context` property. The [JSON-LD
Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context) is described in detail in
the [[!JSON-LD]] specification. The rules for this statement are:

  1. A DID document MUST have exactly one top-level context statement. 
  2. The key for this property MUST be `@context`. 
  3. The value of this key MUST be the URL for the generic DID context: `https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1`. 

Example (using an example URL):

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"
    }
    

DID method specifications MAY define their own JSON-LD contexts. However it is
NOT RECOMMENDED to define a new context unless necessary to properly implement
the method. Method-specific contexts MUST NOT override the terms defined in
the generic DID context.

##  DID Subject

The DID subject is the entity that the DID document is about, i.e., it is the
entity identified by the DID and described by the DID document. The rules for
a DID subject are:

  1. A DID document MUST have exactly one DID subject. 
  2. The key for this property MUST be id. 
  3. The value of this key MUST be a valid DID. 
  4. When this DID document is registered with the target DID registry, the registered DID MUST match this DID subject value. 

Example:

    
    
    {
      "id": "did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp"
    }
    

DID method specifications MAY create intermediate representations of a DID
document that do not contain the `id` key, such as when a DID resolver is
performing resolution. However, the fully resolved DID document MUST contain a
valid `id` property.

##  Public Keys

Public keys are used for digital signatures, encryption and other
cryptographic operations, which in turn are the basis for purposes such as
authentication (see Section ) or establishing secure communication with
service endpoints (see Section ). In addition, public keys may play a role in
authorization mechanisms of DID CRUD operations (see Section ). This may be
defined by DID method specifications.

If a public key does not exist in the DID document, it MUST be assumed the key
has been revoked or is invalid. The DID document MAY contain revoked keys. A
DID document that contains a revoked key MUST also contain or refer to the
revocation information for the key (e.g., a revocation list). Each DID method
specification is expected to detail how revocation is performed and tracked.

The rules for public keys are:

  1. A DID document MAY include a `publicKey` property. 
  2. The value of the `publicKey` property MUST be an array of public keys, and every public key property MUST be in the [Linked Data Cryptographic Suite Registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-cryptosuite-registry). 
  3. Each public key SHOULD include an `id` property. The array of public keys MUST NOT contain multiple entries with the same `id`. A DID document processor MUST produce an error in that case. 
  4. Each public key MUST include a `type` property and exactly one public key value, and MAY include additional properties. 
  5. Each public key MUST include a `controller` property, which identifies the controller of the corresponding private key. 
  6. A registry of key types and formats is available in Appendix . 

The following is a non-exhaustive list of public key properties used by the
community: `publicKeyPem`, `publicKeyJwk`, `publicKeyHex`, `publicKeyBase64`,
`publicKeyBase58`, `publicKeyMultibase`, `ethereumAddress`.

Example:

    
    
    {
      "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1", "https://w3id.org/security/v1"],
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "publicKey": [{
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        "type": "RsaVerificationKey2018",
        "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
        "controller": "did:example:pqrstuvwxyz0987654321",
        "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-3",
        "type": "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",
        "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyHex": "02b97c30de767f084ce3080168ee293053ba33b235d7116a3263d29f1450936b71"
      }],
      ...
    }
    

A key MAY be _embedded_ or _referenced_ in a DID document. For example, the
`authentication` property may refer to keys in both ways:

    
    
    {
    ...
    
      "authentication": [
        // this key is referenced, it may be used for more than one proof purpose
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        // this key is embedded and may *only* be used for authentication
        {
          "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
          "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
          "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
          "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        }
      ],
    
    ...
    }
    

The algorithm to use when processing a `publicKey` property in a DID document
is:

  1. Let _value_ be the data associated with the `publicKey` property and initialize _result_ to `null`. 
  2. If _value_ is an object, the key material is embedded. Set _result_ to _value_. 
  3. If _value_ is a string, the key is included by reference. Assume _value_ is a URL. 
    1. Dereference the URL and retrieve the `publicKey` properties associated with the URL (e.g., process the `publicKey` property at the top-level of the dereferenced document). 
    2. Iterate through each public key object. 
      1. If the `id` property of the object matches _value_ , set _result_ to the object. 
  4. If _result_ does not contain at least the `id`, `type`, and `controller` properties as well as any mandatory public cryptographic material, as determined by the _result_ 's `type` property, throw an error. 

While the `controller` field may seem redundant in some of the examples above,
keys may be expressed in a DID document where the controller is described in
another DID document. Linked Data Proof libraries typically expect the
`controller` field to always exist and may throw an exception if it is
missing. Furthermore, per the requirement that DID documents be interpretable
as either a graph or a tree, a default `controller` field cannot be inferred
by using a key's position in a tree.

Caching and expiration of the keys in a DID document is entirely the
responsibility of DID resolvers and other clients. See Section .

##  Authentication

Authentication is the mechanism by which the DID controller(s) can
cryptographically prove that they are associated with that DID. See Section .
Note that Authentication is separate from Authorization because the DID
controller(s) may wish to enable others to update their DID Document (for
example, to assist with key recovery as discussed in Section ) without
enabling them to prove control (and thus be able to impersonate the DID
controller(s)).

The rules for Authentication are:

  1. A DID document MAY include an `authentication` property. 
  2. The value of the `authentication` property SHOULD be an array of verification methods. 
  3. Each verification method MAY be embedded or referenced. An example of a verification method is a public key (see Section ). 

Example:

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "authentication": [
        // this method can be used to authenticate as did:...fghi
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        // this method can be used to authenticate as did:...fghi
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#biometric-1",
        // this method is *only* authorized for authentication, it may not
        // be used for any other proof purpose, so its full description is
        // embedded here rather than using only a reference
        {
          "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
          "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
          "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
          "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        }
      ],
      ...
    }
    

##  Authorization and Delegation

Authorization is the mechanism used to state how operations may be performed
on behalf of the DID subject. Delegation is the mechanism that the subject may
use to authorize others to act on their behalf. Note that Authorization is
separate from Authentication as explained in Section . This is particularly
important for key recovery in the case of key loss, when the subject no longer
has access to their keys, or key compromise, where the DID controller's
trusted third parties need to override malicious activity by an attacker. See
Section .

Each DID method MUST define how authorization and delegation are implemented,
including any necessary cryptographic operations.

There are at least two suggested methods for implementing Authorization and
Delegation, which may be layered:

  1. A DID registry could implement a coarse grained `controller` pattern by enabling DID documents to express the DID of another DID controller that controls it, or additionally, 
  2. A DID registry could implement a Capabilities-based approach that enables further fine-grained control of authorization and delegation. 

Example:

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "controller": "did:example:bcehfew7h32f32h7af3",
      "service": [{
        // used to retrieve Verifiable Credentials associated with the DID
        "type": "VerifiableCredentialService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/vc/"
      }]
    }
            

##  Service Endpoints

In addition to publication of authentication and authorization mechanisms, the
other primary purpose of a DID document is to enable discovery of service
endpoints for the DID subject. A service endpoint MAY represent any type of
service the DID subject wishes to advertise, including decentralized identity
management services for further discovery, authentication, authorization, or
interaction. The rules for service endpoints are:

  1. A DID document MAY include a `service` property. 
  2. The value of the `service` property SHOULD be an array of service endpoints. 
  3. Each service endpoint SHOULD include an `id` property. The array of service endpoints MUST NOT contain multiple entries with the same `id`. A DID document processor MUST produce an error in that case. 
  4. Each service endpoint MUST include `type` and `serviceEndpoint` properties, and MAY include additional properties. 
  5. The service endpoint protocol SHOULD be published in an open standard specification. 
  6. The value of the `serviceEndpoint` property MUST be a JSON-LD object or a valid URI conforming to [[RFC3986]] and normalized according to the rules in section 6 of [[RFC3986]] and to any normalization rules in its applicable URI scheme specification. 

Example:

    
    
    {
      "service": [{
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#openid",
        "type": "OpenIdConnectVersion1.0Service",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://openid.example.com/"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vcr",
        "type": "CredentialRepositoryService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://repository.example.com/service/8377464"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#xdi",
        "type": "XdiService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://xdi.example.com/8377464"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#agent",
        "type": "AgentService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://agent.example.com/8377464"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#hub",
        "type": "IdentityHub",
        "publicKey": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1",
        "serviceEndpoint": {
          "@context": "https://schema.identity.foundation/hub",
          "type": "UserHubEndpoint",
          "instances": ["did:example:456", "did:example:789"]
        }
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#messages",
        "type": "MessagingService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/messages/8377464"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#inbox",
        "type": "SocialWebInboxService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://social.example.com/83hfh37dj",
        "description": "My public social inbox",
        "spamCost": {
          "amount": "0.50",
          "currency": "USD"
        }
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#authpush",
        "type": "DidAuthPushModeVersion1",
        "serviceEndpoint": "http://auth.example.com/did:example:123456789abcdefg"
      }]
    }
    

See Sections  and  for further security considerations regarding
authentication service endpoints.

##  Created (Optional)

Standard metadata for identifier records includes a timestamp of the original
creation. The rules for including a creation timestamp are:

  1. A DID document MUST have zero or one property representing a creation timestamp. It is RECOMMENDED to include this property. 
  2. The key for this property MUST be created. 
  3. The value of this key MUST be a valid XML datetime value as defined in section 3.3.7 of [W3C XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) 1.1 Part 2: Datatypes](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/) [[!XMLSCHEMA11-2]]. 
  4. This datetime value MUST be normalized to UTC 00:00 as indicated by the trailing "Z". 
  5. Method specifications that rely on DLTs SHOULD require time values that are after the known ["median time past" (defined in Bitcoin BIP 113)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki), when the DLT supports such a notion. 

Example:

    
    
    {
      "created": "2002-10-10T17:00:00Z"
    }
    

##  Updated (Optional)

Standard metadata for identifier records includes a timestamp of the most
recent change. The rules for including an updated timestamp are:

  1. A DID document MUST have zero or one property representing an updated timestamp. It is RECOMMENDED to include this property. 
  2. The key for this property MUST be updated. 
  3. The value of this key MUST follow the formatting rules (3, 4, 5) from Section . 

Example:

    
    
    {
      "updated": "2016-10-17T02:41:00Z"
    }
    

##  Proof (Optional)

A `proof` on a DID document is cryptographic proof of the integrity of the DID
document according to either:

  1. The DID subject as defined in Section , or: 
  2. The DID controller as defined in Section , if present. 

This proof is NOT proof of the binding between a DID and a DID document. See
Section . The rules for a proof are:

  1. A DID document MAY have exactly one property representing a proof. 
  2. The key for this property MUST be `proof`. 
  3. The value of this key MUST be a valid JSON-LD proof as defined by [Linked Data Proofs](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/). 

Example:

    
    
    {
      "proof": {
        "type": "LinkedDataSignature2015",
        "created": "2016-02-08T16:02:20Z",
        "creator": "did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1ja#keys-1",
        "signatureValue": "QNB13Y7Q9...1tzjn4w=="
      }
    }
    

##  Extensibility

One of the goals of the decentralized identifiers data model is to enable
permissionless innovation. This requires that the data model is extensible in
a number of different ways:

  * The requirement to model complex multi-entity relationships is provided through the use of a graph-based data model. 
  * The requirement to enable extending the machine-readable vocabularies used to describe information in the data model -- without relying on a centralized system -- is accomplished via the use of [[LINKED-DATA]]. 
  * The requirement to support multiple types of cryptographic proof formats is accomplished via the use of Linked Data Proofs [[LD-PROOFS]], Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]], and a variety of signature suites. 
  * The requirement to provide all of the extensibility mechanisms outlined above in a data format that is popular among software developers and web page authors is enabled via the use of [[!JSON-LD]]. 

This approach to data modeling is often called an "open world assumption",
meaning that anyone can say anything about any other thing. This approach
often feels in conflict with building simple and predictable software systems.
Balancing extensibility with program correctness is always more challenging
with an open world assumption than it is with closed software systems.

The rest of this section describes how both extensibility and program
correctness are achieved through a series of examples.

Let us assume that we start with the following DID document:

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://example.org/example-method/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "publicKey": [{ ... }],
      "authentication": [{ ... }],
      "service": [{ ... }]
    }
          

The contents of the `publicKey`, `authentication`, and `service` properties
are not important for the purposes of this section. What is important is that
the object above is a valid DID document. Let's assume that a developer wanted
to extend the DID document to express an additional piece of information: the
subject's public photo stream.

The first thing that a developer would do is create a JSON-LD Context
containing the new term:

    
    
    {
      "@context": {
        "PhotoStreamService": "https://example.com/vocab#PhotoStreamService"
      }
    }
          

Now that the JSON-LD Context has been created, the developer MUST publish it
somewhere that is accessible to any DID document processor. For this example,
let us assume that the JSON-LD Context above is published at the following
URL: `did:example:contexts:987654321`. At this point, extending the first
example in this section is a simple matter of including the context above and
adding the new property to the DID document.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://example.org/example-method/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "authentication": [ ... ],
      "service": [{
        "@context": "did:example:contexts:987654321",
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#photos",
        "type": "PhotoStreamService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.org/photos/379283"
      }]
    }
          

The examples so far have shown that it is easy to extend the decentralized
identifiers data model in a permissionless and decentralized way. The
mechanism also ensures that decentralized identifiers created in this way
prevent namespace conflicts and semantic ambiguity.

An extensibility model that is this dynamic does increase implementation
burden. Software written for such a system will have to determine if accepting
DID documents with extensions is acceptable based on the risk profile of the
application. Some applications may choose to accept but ignore extensions,
others may choose to only accept certain extensions, while highly secure
environments may disallow extensions. These decisions are up to the
application developers and are specifically not the domain of this
specification.

Implementations MUST produce an error when an extension JSON-LD Context
overrides the expanded URL for a term specified in this specification. To
avoid the possibility of accidentally overriding terms, developers SHOULD
scope their extensions. For example, the following extension scopes the new
`PhotoStreamService` term so that it may only be used within the `service`
property:

    
    
    {
      "@context": {
        "service": {
          "@id": "https://w3id.org/did#service",
          "@context": {
            "PhotoStreamService": "https://example.com/vocab#PhotoStreamService"
          }
        }
      }
    }
          

Developers are urged to ensure that extension JSON-LD Contexts are highly
available. Implementations that cannot fetch a context will produce an error.
Strategies for ensuring that extension JSON-LD Contexts are always available
include using content-addressed URLs for contexts, bundling context documents
with implementations, or enabling aggressive caching of contexts.

#  DID Document Syntax

A DID document MUST be a single JSON object conforming to [[!RFC8259]]. Many
of the concepts in this document were introduced by example using the JSON-LD
syntax, a format for mapping JSON data into the RDF semantic graph model as
defined by [[!JSON-LD]]. This section formalizes how the data model (described
in Sections  and ) is realized in JSON-LD.

Although syntactic mappings are provided for JSON and JSON-LD only,
applications and services can use any other data representation syntax, such
as JXD (JSON XDI Data, a serialization format for the [ XDI graph
model](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xdi/xdi-core/v1.0/csd01/xdi-
core-v1.0-csd01.xml)), XML, YAML, or CBOR, that is capable of expressing the
data model.

### JSON

The data model as described in Section  can be encoded in Javascript Object
Notation (JSON) [[RFC8259]] by mapping property values to JSON types as
follows:

  * Numeric values representable as IEEE754 SHOULD be represented as a Number type. 
  * Boolean values SHOULD be represented as a Boolean type. 
  * Sequence value SHOULD be represented as an Array type. 
  * Unordered sets of values SHOULD be represented as an Array type. 
  * Sets of properties SHOULD be represented as an Object type. 
  * Empty values SHOULD be represented as a null value. 
  * Other values MUST be represented as a String type. 

##  JSON-LD

[[!JSON-LD]] is a JSON-based format used to serialize [Linked
Data](http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data). The syntax is designed
to easily integrate into deployed systems already using JSON, and provides a
smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily intended to be a way
to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build
interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage
engines.

JSON-LD is useful when extending the data model described in this
specification. Instances of the data model are encoded in JSON-LD in the same
way they are encoded in JSON (Section ), with the addition of the `@context`
property. The [JSON-LD Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context) is
described in detail in the [[!JSON-LD]] specification and its use is
elaborated on in Section .

In general, the data model and syntaxes described in this document are
designed such that developers can copy and paste examples into their software
systems. The design goal of this approach is to provide a low barrier to entry
while still ensuring global interoperability between a heterogeneous set of
software systems. This section describes some of these approaches, which will
likely go unnoticed by most developers, but whose details will be of interest
to implementers. Noteworthy features provided by JSON-LD are:

  * The `@id` and `@type` keywords are aliased to `id` and `type` respectively, enabling developers to use this specification as idiomatic JSON. 
  * Data types, such as integers, dates, units of measure, and URLs, are automatically typed to provide stronger type guarantees for use cases that require them. 
  * The `@protected` properties feature of JSON-LD 1.1 is used to ensure that terms defined by this specification cannot be overridden. This means that as long as the same `@context` declaration is made at the top of a DID document, that interoperability is guaranteed between implementations which use a JSON-LD processor and implementations which do not. 

#  DID Methods

##  DID Method Schemes

A DID method specification MUST define exactly one specific DID scheme
identified by exactly one method name (the `method-name` rule in Section ).

Since the method name is part of the DID, it SHOULD be as short as practical.
A method name of five characters or less is RECOMMENDED. The method name MAY
reflect the name of the DID registry to which the DID method specification
applies.

The DID method specification for the specific DID scheme MUST specify how to
generate the `method-specific-id` component of a DID. The `method-specific-id`
value MUST be able to be generated without the use of a centralized registry
service. The `method-specific-id` value SHOULD be globally unique by itself.
The DID as defined by the `did` rule in Section  MUST be globally unique.

If needed, a specific DID scheme MAY define multiple specific `method-
specific-id` formats. It is RECOMMENDED that a specific DID scheme define as
few `method-specific-id` formats as possible.

##  DID Operations

To enable the full functionality of DIDs and DID documents on a particular DID
registry, a DID method specification MUST specify how each of the following [
CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
operations is performed by a client. Each operation MUST be specified to the
level of detail necessary to build and test interoperable client
implementations with the target system. The specification document for a DID
method that does not support specific operations such as Update and Deactivate
MUST clearly specify these limitations. Note that, due to the specified
contents of DID documents, these operations can effectively be used to perform
all the operations required of a CKMS (cryptographic key management system),
e.g.,:

  * Key registration 
  * Key replacement 
  * Key rotation 
  * Key recovery 
  * Key expiration 

###  Create

The DID method specification MUST specify how a client creates a DID and its
associated DID document on the DID registry, including all cryptographic
operations necessary to establish proof of control.

###  Read/Verify

The DID method specification MUST specify how a client uses a DID to request a
DID document from the DID registry, including how the client can verify the
authenticity of the response.

###  Update

The DID method specification MUST specify how a client can update a DID
document on the DID registry, including all cryptographic operations necessary
to establish proof of control, _or_ state that updates are not possible.

###  Deactivate

Although a core feature of distributed ledgers is immutability, the DID method
specification MUST specify how a client can deactivate a DID on the DID
registry, including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof
of deactivation _or_ state that deactivation is not possible.

##  Unique DID Method Names

The authors of a new DID method specification SHOULD use a method name that is
unique among all DID method names known to them at the time of publication.

Because there is no central authority for allocating or approving DID method
names, there is no way to know for certain if a particular DID method name is
unique. To help with this challenge, the [W3C Credentials Community
Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/) maintains a non-
authoritative list of known DID method names and their associated
specifications (see Appendix ).

The [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] is a tool for implementors to use when coming to
consensus on a new method name, as well as an informative reference for
software developers implementing  for different DID methods. The [[DID-METHOD-
REGISTRY]] is not a definitive or official list of DID methods. Nonetheless,
adding DID method names to the [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] is encouraged so that
other implementors and members of the community have a place to see an
overview of existing DID methods. The lightweight criteria for inclusion are
documented in the [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]].

#  DID Resolvers

A DID resolver is a software or hardware component with an API for resolving
DIDs of at least one DID method. It executes the corresponding DID method's
Read operation to obtain the authoritative DID document.

The interfaces and algorithms for resolving DIDs and dereferencing DID URLs
are specified in [[DID-RESOLUTION]].

#  Security Considerations

NOTE TO IMPLEMENTERS: During the Implementerâ€™s Draft stage, this section
focuses on security topics that should be important in early implementations.
The editors are also seeking feedback on threats and threat mitigations that
should be reflected in this section or elsewhere in the spec. As the root
identifier records for decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and DID documents are
a vital component of decentralized identity management. They are also the
foundational building blocks of decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI)
as an augmentation to conventional X.509 certificates. As such, DIDs are
designed to operate under the general Internet threat model used by many IETF
standards. We assume uncompromised endpoints, but allow messages to be read or
corrupted on the network. Protecting against an attack when a system is
compromised requires external key-signing hardware. See also Section
regarding key revocation and recovery. For their part, the DLTs hosting DIDs
and DID documents have special security properties for preventing active
attacks. Their design uses public/private key cryptography to allow operation
on passively monitored networks without risking compromise of private keys.
This is what makes DID architecture and decentralized identity possible.

##  Requirements of DID Method Specifications

  1. DID method specifications MUST include their own Security Considerations sections. 
  2. This section MUST consider all the requirements mentioned in section 5 of [[RFC3552]] (page 27) for the DID operations defined in the specification. In particular: 

Discussions at Rebooting the Web of Trust 5 resulted in consensus to move
Authorization to DID method specifications. It is currently expected that
there will be an attempt to create a generalized authorization mechanism that
is build on object capabilities.

At least the following forms of attack MUST be considered: eavesdropping,
replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle.
Potential denial of service attacks MUST be identified as well. If the
protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, it should be
clearly indicated which portions of the data are protected and what the
protections are (i.e., integrity only, confidentiality, and/or endpoint
authentication, etc.). Some indication should also be given to what sorts of
attacks the cryptographic protection is susceptible. Data which should be held
secret (keying material, random seeds, etc.) should be clearly labeled. If the
technology involves authentication, particularly user-host authentication, the
security of the authentication method MUST be clearly specified.

  3. This section MUST also discuss, per Section 5 of [[RFC3552]], residual risks (such as the risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation, or cipher) after threat mitigation has been deployed. 
  4. This section MUST provide integrity protection and update authentication for all operations required by Section . 
  5. Where DID methods make use of peer-to-peer computing resources (such as with all known DLTs), the expected burdens of those resources SHOULD be discussed in relation to denial of service. 
  6. Method-specific endpoint authentication MUST be discussed. Where DID methods make use of DLTs with varying network topology, sometimes offered as "light node" or "[thin client](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security)" implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security assumptions of the topology available to implementations of the DID method MUST be discussed. 
  7. DID methods MUST discuss the policy mechanism by which DIDs are proven to be uniquely assigned. A DID fits the functional definition of a URN as defined in [[RFC8141]] -- a persistent identifier that is assigned once to a resource and never reassigned. In a security context this is particularly important since a DID may be used to identify a specific party subject to a specific set of authorization rights. 
  8. DID methods that introduce new authentication service endpoint types (Section ) SHOULD consider the security requirements of the supported authentication protocol. 

##  Choosing DID Resolvers

The [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] is an informative list of DID method names and
their corresponding DID method specifications. Implementors should bear in
mind that there is no central authority to mandate which DID method
specification must be used with any particular DID method name, but can use
the [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] to make an informed decision when choosing which
DID resolver implementations to use.

##  Binding of Identity

###  Proving Control of a DID and DID Document

Signatures are one method to allow DID documents to be cryptographically
verifiable.

By itself, a verified signature on a self-signed DID document does not prove
control of a DID. It only proves the following:

  1. The DID document has not been tampered with since it was registered. 
  2. The DID controller(s) controlled the private key used for the signature at the time the signature was generated. 

Proving control of a DID, i.e., the binding between the DID and the DID
document that describes it, requires a two step process:

  1. Resolving the DID to a DID document according to its DID method specification. 
  2. Verifying that the `id` property of the resulting DID document matches the DID that was resolved. 

It should be noted that this process proves control of a DID and DID document
regardless of whether the DID document is signed.

Signatures on DID documents are optional. DID method specifications SHOULD
explain and specify their implementation if applicable.

It is RECOMMENDED to combine timestamps with signatures.

###  Proving Control of a Public Key

There are two methods for proving control of the private key corresponding to
a public key description in the DID document: static and dynamic. The static
method is to sign the DID document with the private key. This proves control
of the private key at a time no later than the DID document was registered. If
the DID document is not signed, control of a public key described in the DID
document may still be proven dynamically as follows:

  1. Send a challenge message containing a public key description from the DID document and a nonce to an appropriate service endpoint described in the DID document. 
  2. Verify the signature of the response message against the public key description. 

###  Authentication and Verifiable Claims

A DID and DID document do not inherently carry any [
PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information)
(personally-identifiable information). The process of binding a DID to
something in the real-world such as a person or company, for example with
credentials with the same subject as that DID, is out of scope for this
specification. However this topic is the focus of the [verifiable
claims](https://w3c.github.io/vctf/) standardization work at the W3C (where
the term "DID" originated).

##  Authentication Service Endpoints

If a DID document publishes a service endpoint intended for authentication or
authorization of the DID subject (section ), it is the responsibility of the
service endpoint provider, subject, and/or relying party to comply with the
requirements of the authentication protocol(s) supported at that service
endpoint.

##  Non-Repudiation

Non-repudiation of DIDs and DID document updates is supported under the
assumption that: (1) the subject is monitoring for unauthorized updates (see
Section ) and (2) the subject has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious
updates according to the DID method's access control mechanism (section ).
This capability is further supported if timestamps are included (sections  and
) and the target DLT system supports timestamps.

##  Notification of DID Document Changes

One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a DID document is monitoring
and actively notifying the DID subject when there are changes. This is
analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to the
email addresses on file. In the case of a DID, where there is no intermediary
registrar or account provider to generate the notification, the following
approaches are RECOMMENDED:

  1. Subscriptions. If the DID registry on which the DID is registered directly supports change notifications, this service can be offered to DID controllers. Notifications MAY be sent directly to the relevant service endpoints listed in an existing DID. 
  2. Self-monitoring. A DID subject MAY employ their own local or online agent to periodically monitor for changes to a DID document. 
  3. Third-party monitoring. A DID subject MAY rely on a third party monitoring service, however this introduces another vector of attack. 

##  Key and Signature Expiration

In a decentralized identifier architecture, there are no centralized
authorities to enforce key or signature expiration policies. Therefore DID
resolvers and other client applications SHOULD validate that keys were not
expired at the time they were used. Since some use cases may have legitimate
reasons why already-expired keys can be extended, a key expiration SHOULD NOT
prevent any further use of the key, and implementations of a resolver SHOULD
be compatible with such extension behavior.

##  Key Revocation and Recovery

Section  specifies the DID operations that must be supported by a DID method
specification, including deactivation of a DID document by replacing it with
an updated DID document. In general, checking for key revocation on DLT-based
methods is expected to be handled in a manner similar to checking the balance
of a cryptocurrency account on a distributed ledger: if the balance is empty,
the entire DID is deactivated. DID method specifications SHOULD enable support
for a quorum of trusted parties to enable key recovery. Some of the facilities
to do so are suggested in section 6.5, Authorization. Note that not all DID
method specifications will recognize control from DIDs registered using other
DID methods and they MAY restrict third-party control to DIDs that use the
same method. Access control and key recovery in a DID method specification MAY
also include a time lock feature to protect against key compromise by
maintaining a second track of control for recovery. Further specification of
this type of control is a matter for future work (see Section ).

##  The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers

DIDs achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central registration
authority. This comes, however, at the cost of human memorability. The
algorithms capable of generating globally unique identifiers automatically
produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This
demonstrates the axiom about identifiers known as [Zooko's
Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle): "human-
meaningful, decentralized, secure -- pick any two".

There are of course many use cases where it is desirable to discover a DID
when starting from a human-friendly identifier -- a natural language name, a
domain name, or a conventional address for a DID controller such as a mobile
telephone number, email address, Twitter handle, or blog URL. However, the
problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to DIDs (and doing so in a way
that can be verified and trusted) is out-of-scope for this specification.

Solutions to this problem (and there are many) should be defined in separate
specifications that reference this specification. It is strongly recommended
that such specifications carefully consider: (a) the numerous security attacks
based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly identifier for a target
entity, and (b) the privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers
that are inherently correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.

A draft specification for discovering a DID from domain names and e-mail
addresses using DNS lookups is available at [[DNS-DID]].

##  Immutability

Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and the
assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Like any ecosystem, the DID
ecosystem has some potential for this to occur. Because this spec is focused
on a data model rather than a protocol, it offers no opinion about many
aspects of how that model is put to use. However, individual DID methods may
wish to consider constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics they
don't need. The more "locked down" a DID method is, while providing the same
set of features, the less it can be manipulated by malicious actors.

As an example, consider the flexibility that the data model offers with
respect to updating. A single edit to a DID document can change anything and
everything except the root `id` property of the document -- and any individual
JSON object in the data model can change all of its properties except its
`id`. But is it actually desirable for a service endpoint to change its `type`
once it's been defined? Or for a key to change its value? Or would it be
better to require a new `id` when certain fundamental properties of an object
change? Malicious takeovers of a web site often aim for an outcome where the
site keeps its identifier (the host name), but gets subtle, dangerous changes
underneath. If certain properties of the site were required by spec to be
immutable (e.g., the [
ASN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_\(Internet\)) associated
with its IP address), such attacks might be much harder and more expensive to
carry out -- and anomaly detection would be easier.

The notion that immutability may provide some cybersecurity benefits is
particularly relevant because of caching. For DID methods tied to a global
source of truth, a direct, just-in-time lookup of the latest version of a DID
document is always possible. However, it seems likely that layers of cache
might eventually sit between a client and that source of truth. If they do,
believing the attributes of an object in the DID document to have a given
state, when they are actually subtly different, may invite exploits. This is
particularly true if some lookups are of a full DID document, and others are
of partial data, where the larger context is assumed.

#  Privacy Considerations

It is critically important to apply the principles of Privacy by Design to all
aspects of decentralized identifier architecture, because DIDs and DID
Documents are -- by design -- administered directly by the DID controller(s).
There is no registrar, hosting company, or other intermediate service provider
to recommend or apply additional privacy safeguards. The authors of this
specification have applied all seven Privacy by Design principles throughout
its development. For example, privacy in this specification is preventative
not remedial, and privacy is an embedded default. Furthermore, decentralized
identifier architecture by itself embodies principle #7, "Respect for user
privacy -- keep it user-centric." This section lists additional privacy
considerations that implementers, delegates, and DID subjects should bear in
mind.

##  Requirements of DID Method Specifications

  1. DID method specifications MUST include their own Privacy Considerations sections, if only to point to the general privacy considerations in this section. 
  2. The DID method specification's Privacy Considerations section MUST discuss any subsection of section 5 of [[RFC6973]] that could apply in a method-specific manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored data compromise, unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation, identification, secondary use, disclosure, exclusion. 

##  Keep Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) Private

If a DID method specification is written for a public DID registry where all
DIDs and DID documents will be publicly available, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED
that DID documents contain no PII. All PII should be kept behind service
endpoints under the control of the DID subject. With this privacy
architecture, PII may be exchanged on a private, peer-to-peer basis using
communications channels identified and secured by public key descriptions in
DID documents. This also enables DID subjects and relying parties to implement
the [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)
[right to be forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten),
as no PII will be written to an immutable distributed ledger.

##  DID Correlation Risks and Pseudonymous DIDs

Like any type of globally unique identifier, DIDs may be used for correlation.
DID controllers can mitigate this privacy risk by using pairwise unique DIDs,
i.e., by sharing a different private DID for every relationship. In effect,
each DID acts as a pseudonym. A pseudonymous DID need only be shared with more
than one party when the DID subject explicitly authorizes correlation between
those parties. If pseudonymous DIDs are the default, then the only need for a
public DID -- a DID published openly or shared with a large number of parties
-- is when the DID subject explicitly desires public identification.

##  DID Document Correlation Risks

The anti-correlation protections of pseudonymous DIDs are easily defeated if
the data in the corresponding DID documents can be correlated. For example,
using same public key descriptions or bespoke service endpoints in multiple
DID documents can provide as much correlation information as using the same
DID. Therefore the DID document for a pseudonymous DID SHOULD also use
pairwise-unique public keys. It might seem natural to also use pairwise-unique
service endpoints in the DID document for a pseudonymous DID. However, unique
endpoints allow all traffic between to DIDs to be isolated perfectly into
unique buckets, where timing correlation and similar analysis is easy.
Therefore, a better strategy for endpoint privacy may be to share an endpoint
among thousands or millions of DIDs controlled by many different subjects.

##  Herd Privacy

When a DID subject is indistinguishable from others in the herd, privacy is
available. When the act of engaging privately with another party is by itself
a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished. DIDs and DID methods
SHOULD work to improve herd privacy, particularly for those who legitimately
need it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces that default to
preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. In order to reduce [digital
fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint), share common
settings across client implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum
on wire protocols, use encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to
standard lengths.

#  Future Work

##  Upper Limits on DID Character Length

The current specification does not take a position on maximum length of a DID.
The maximum interoperable URL length is currently about 2K characters. QR
codes can handle about 4K characters. Clients using DIDs will be responsible
for storing many DIDs, and some methods would be able to externalize some of
their costs onto clients by relying on more complicated signature schemes or
by adding state into DIDs intended for temporary use. A future version of this
specification should set reasonable limits on DID character length to minimize
externalities.

##  Equivalence

Including an equivalence property, such as `equivID`, in DID documents whose
value is an array of DIDs would allow subjects to assert two or more DIDs that
represent the same subject. This capability has numerous uses, including
supporting migration between DID registries and providing forward
compatibility of existing DIDs to future DID registries. In theory, equivalent
DIDs should have the same identifier rights, allowing [verifiable
claims](https://w3c.github.io/vctf/) made against one DID to apply to
equivalent DIDs. Equivalence was not included in the current specification due
to the complexity of verifying equivalence across different DLTs and different
DID methods, and also of aggregating properties of equivalent DID documents.
However equivalence should be supported in a future version of this
specification.

##  Timestamps

Verifiable timestamps have significant utility for identifier records. This is
a good fit for DLTs, since most offer some type of timestamp mechanism.
Despite some transactional cost, they are the most censorship-resistant
transaction ordering systems in the world, so they are nearly ideal for DID
document timestamping. In some cases a DLT's immediate timing is approximate,
however their sense of [ "median time past" (see Bitcoin BIP
113)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki%23Abstract)
can be precisely defined. A generic DID document timestamping mechanism could
would work across all DLTs and might operate via a mechanism including either
individual transactions or transaction batches. The generic mechanism was
deemed out of scope for this version, although it may be included in a future
version of this specification.

##  Time Locks and DID Document Recovery

Section  mentions one possible clever use of time locks to recover control of
a DID after a key compromise. The technique relies on an ability to override
the most recent update to a DID document with Authorization applied by an
earlier version of the DID document in order to defeat the attacker. This
protection depends on adding a [ time lock (see Bitcoin BIP
65)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki%23Abstract)
to protect part of the transaction chain, enabling a Authorization block to be
used to recover control. We plan to add support for time locks in a future
version of this specification.

##  Smart Signatures

Not all DLTs can support the Authorization logic in section 6.5. Therefore, in
this version of the specification, all Authorization logic MUST be delegated
to DID method specifications. A potential future solution is a [Smart
Signature](http://www.weboftrust.info/downloads/smart-signatures.pdf)
specification that specifies the code any conformant DLT may implement to
process signature control logic.

##  Verifiable Claims

Although DIDs and DID documents form a foundation for decentralized identity,
they are only the first step in describing their subjects. The rest of the
descriptive power comes through collecting and selectively using [verifiable
claims](https://w3c.github.io/vctf/). Future versions of the specification
will describe in more detail how DIDs and DID document can be integrated with
-- and help enable -- the verifiable claims ecosystem.

##  Alternate Serializations and Graph Models

This version of the specification relies on JSON-LD and the RDF graph model
for expressing a DID document. Future versions of this specification MAY
specify other semantic graph formats for a DID document, such as JXD (JSON XDI
Data), a serialization format for the XDI graph model as defined by the [
OASIS XDI Core 1.0 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xdi/xdi-
core/v1.0/csd01/xdi-core-v1.0-csd01.xml).
