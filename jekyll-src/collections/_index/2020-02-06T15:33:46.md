Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier to provide
verifiable, decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers are designed
to enable the controller of a DID to prove control over it and to be
implemented independently of any centralized registry, identity provider, or
certificate authority. DIDs are URLs that relate a DID subject to a DID
document allowing trustable interactions with that subject. DID documents are
simple documents describing how to use that specific DID. Each DID document
can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or service
endpoints, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID controller to
prove control of the DID. Service endpoints enable trusted interactions with
the DID subject.

This document specifies a common data model, a URL format, and a set of
operations for DIDs, DID documents, and DID methods.

This specification is under active development and implementers are advised
against implementing the specification unless they are directly involved with
the W3C DID Working Group. There are use cases [[?DID-USE-CASES]] in active
development that establish requirements for this document.

At present, there exist [40 experimental
implementations](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/#the-registry)
and a preliminary [test suite](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-test-suite/)
that will eventually determine whether or not implementations are conformant.
Readers are advised that Appendix  contains a list of concerns and proposed
changes that will most likely result in alterations to this specification.

#  Introduction

Conventional [identity
management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management) systems are
based on centralized authorities such as corporate [directory
services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_service), [certificate
authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority), or [domain
name registries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry). From the
standpoint of cryptographic trust verification, each of these centralized
authorities serves as its own [root of
trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_anchor). To make identity
management work across these systems requires implementing [federated identity
management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity).

The emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain technology
provides the opportunity for fully decentralized identity management. In a
decentralized identity system, entities (that is, discrete identifiable units
such as, but not limited to, people, organizations, and things) are free to
use any shared root of trust. Globally distributed ledgers, decentralized P2P
networks, or other systems with similar capabilities, provide the means for
managing a root of trust without introducing a centralized authority or a
single point of failure. In combination, DLTs and decentralized identity
management systems enable any entity to create and manage their own
identifiers on any number of distributed, independent roots of trust.

Entities are identified by decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and can
authenticate using proofs (for example, digital signatures, privacy-preserving
biometric protocols, and so on). DIDs point to DID documents. A DID document
contains a set of service endpoints for interacting with the entity that the
DID identifies (that is, the DID subject). Following the guidelines of
[Privacy by Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design), any
entity can have as many DIDs (and corresponding DID documents and service
endpoints) as necessary to respect the entityâ€™s desired separation of
identities, personas, and contexts (in the everyday sense of these words).

DID methods are the mechanism by which a DID and its associated DID document
are created, read, updated, and deactivated on a specific distributed ledger
or network. DID methods are defined using separate DID method specifications.

This design eliminates dependence on centralized registries for identifiers as
well as centralized certificate authorities for key management, which is the
standard in hierarchical [PKI (public key
infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure)). In
cases where the DID registry is a distributed ledger, each entity can serve as
its own root authority. This architecture is referred to as [DPKI
(decentralized PKI)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-
trust/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf).

DID methods can also be developed for identifiers registered in federated or
centralized identity management systems. Indeed, all types of identifier
systems can add support for DIDs. This creates an interoperability bridge
between the worlds of centralized, federated, and decentralized identifiers.

The first purpose of this specification is to define the generic DID scheme
and a generic set of operations on DID documents that can be implemented for
any DID registry. The second purpose of this specification is to define the
conformance requirements for a DID method specification. The DID method
specification is a separate document that defines a specific DID scheme and
specific set of DID document operations for a specific DID registry.

Conceptually, the relationship between this specification and a DID method
specification is similar to the relationship between the IETF generic URI
specification ([[RFC3986]]) and a specific URI scheme ([[IANA-URI-SCHEMES]]
(such as the http: and https: schemes specified in [[RFC7230]]). It is also
similar to the relationship between the IETF generic URN specification
([[RFC8141]]) and a specific URN namespace definition, (such as the UUID URN
namespace defined in [[RFC4122]]). The difference is that a DID method
specification, as well as defining a specific DID scheme, also specifies the
methods for resolving and deactivating DIDs on, and writing DID documents to,
the appropriate DID registry.

The hierarchical design of a generic DID specification with specific DID
method specifications introduces some of the same concepts as the URI
specification:

  * DIDs from different DID methods might not be interoperable, just as URIs from different URI schemes might not be interoperable. 
  * Entities might need multiple DIDs to support different relationships because the other party might only support certain DID methods, in the same way that some browsers might only support certain URI schemes. 
  * Entities might need multiple DIDs to support the different cryptographic schemes of different DID methods because not all parties will support the same cryptographic schemes, in the same way that not all browsers support the same URI schemes. 
  * Managing multiple DIDs, and tracking which DID belongs to which relationship, under which cryptographic scheme, introduces similar logistical challenges as managing multiple web addresses and tracking which address belongs to which website, or tracking which email address belongs to which relationship. 

For a list of DID methods and their corresponding specifications, see the DID
Method Registry [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]].

##  A Simple Example

A DID is a simple text string consisting of three parts, the:

  * URL scheme identifier (`did`) 
  * Identifier for the DID method
  * DID method-specific identifier. 

    
    
    did:example:123456789abcdefghi
        

The example DID above resolves to a DID document. A DID document contains
information associated with the DID, such as ways to cryptographically
authenticate the entity in control of the DID, as well as services that can be
used to interact with the entity.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "authentication": [{
        // used to authenticate as did:...fghi
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        "type": "RsaVerificationKey2018",
        "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
      }],
      "service": [{
        // used to retrieve Verifiable Credentials associated with the DID
        "id":"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vcs",
        "type": "VerifiableCredentialService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/vc/"
      }]
    }
        

##  Design Goals

Decentralized Identifiers are a component of larger systems, such as the
Verifiable Credentials ecosystem [[?VC-DATA-MODEL]], which drove the design
goals for this specification. This section summarizes the primary design goals
for this specification.

Goal  |  Description  
---|---  
Decentralization  |  Eliminate the requirement for centralized authorities or
single point failure in identifier management, including the registration of
globally unique identifiers, public verification keys, service endpoints, and
other metadata.  
Control  |  Give entities, both human and non-human, the power to directly
control their digital identifiers without the need to rely on external
authorities.  
Privacy  |  Enable entities to control the privacy of their information,
including minimal, selective, and progressive disclosure of attributes or
other data.  
Security  |  Enable sufficient security for relying parties to depend on DID
documents for their required level of assurance.  
Proof-based  |  Enable DID subjects to provide cryptographic proof when
interacting with other entities.  
Discoverability  |  Make it possible for entities to discover DIDs for other
entities to learn more about or interact with those entities.  
Interoperability  |  Use interoperable standards so DID infrastructure can
make use of existing tools and software libraries designed for
interoperability.  
Portability  |  Be system and network-independent and enable entities to use
their digital identifiers with any system that supports DIDs and DID methods.  
Simplicity  |  Favor a reduced set of simple features to make the technology
easier to understand, implement, and deploy.  
Extensibility  |  Where possible, enable extensibility provided it does not
greatly hinder interoperability, portability, or simplicity.  
  
###  Interoperability

Interoperability of implementations for DIDs and DID documents will be tested
by evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse DIDs and DID
documents that conform to the specification. Interoperability for DID methods
will be determined by evaluating each DID method specification to determine,
at a minimum, that the:

  * DID method name is unique and not used by an existing, incompatible DID method. 
  * Required operations are supported. 
  * Operations requiring descriptions are described. 
  * Specification is specific, detailed, and complete enough for independent implementation. 
  * Specification contains sections describing security and privacy considerations. 

Interoperability for producers and consumers of DIDs and DID documents is
provided by ensuring the DIDs and DID documents conform. Interoperability for
DID method specifications is provided by the details in each DID method
specification. It is understood that, in the same way that a web browser is
not required to implement all known URI schemes, conformant software that
works with DIDs is not required to implement all known DID methods. However,
all implementations of a given DID method must be interoperable for that
method.

#  Terminology

#  Data Model

This section outlines the decentralized identifier data model concepts,
specifically, how keys, services, and the DID subject are related to the DID
document.

For more information about how the data model can be extended, see Section .

##  Identifier

Identifiers are used in the data model to identify specific instances of
people, organizations, devices, keys, services, and things in general.
Identifiers are typically URLs, or more generally, URIs. Non-URI-based
identifiers are not advised because, while the data model supports them, they
are not easy to use with other Internet-based identifiers.

##  DID Document

A DID document is the resource that is associated with a decentralized
identifier (DID). DID documents typically express verification methods (such
as public keys) and services that can be used to interact with a DID
controller.

A DID document is serialized according to a particular syntax, as outlined in
Section ). The DID itself is contained in the `id` property.

The properties that can be present in a DID document are outlined in Section .

The properties present in a DID document can be updated according to the
applicable operations outlined in Section .

##  Cryptographic Keys and Other Verification Methods

A DID document can express cryptographic keys and other verification methods,
which can be used to authenticate or authorize interactions with the DID
subject or associated parties. The information expressed often includes
globally unambiguous identifiers and public key material, which can be used to
verify digital signatures. Other information can be expressed, such as status
information for the key (for example, whether it is suspended or revoked), or
other attributes that enable one to determine whether it is a hardware-backed
cryptographic key.

Regarding cryptographic key material, public keys can be included in a DID
document using, for example, the `publicKey` or `authentication` properties,
depending on what they are to be used for. Each public key has an identifier
(`id`) of its own, a `type`, and a `controller`, as well as other properties
that depend on the type of key it is. For more information, see Section .

This specification strives to limit the number of formats for expressing
public key material in a DID Document to the fewest possible, to increase the
likelihood of interoperability. The fewer formats that implementers have to
implement, the more likely it will be that they will support all of them. This
approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between ease of implementation
and supporting formats that have historically had broad deployment. The
specific types of key formats that are supported in this specification are
listed in .

##  Services

Service endpoints are used in DID documents to express ways of communicating
with the DID subject or associated entities. Services listed in the DID
document can contain information about privacy preserving messaging services,
or more public information, such as social media accounts, personal websites,
and email addresses. The metadata associated with services are often service-
specific. For example, the metadata associated with an encrypted messaging
service can express how to initiate the encrypted link before messaging
begins.

Pointers to services are expressed using the `service` property. Each service
has its own `id` and `type`, as well as a `serviceEndpoint` with a URI or
other properties describing the service.

For more information, see Section .

#  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

The concept of a globally unique decentralized identifier is not new.
Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) were first developed in the 1980s and
later became a standard feature of the Open Software Foundationâ€™s [Distributed
Computing
Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Computing_Environment).
UUIDs achieve global uniqueness without a centralized registry service by
using an algorithm that generates 128-bit values with sufficient entropy that
the chance of collision are infinitesimally small. UUIDs are formally
specified in [[RFC4122]] as a specific type of Unified Resource Name (URN).

A DID is similar to a UUID except that:

  * Like a URL, it can be resolved or dereferenced to a standard resource describing the subject. That is, a DID document. For more information, see Section . 
  * Unlike most resources returned when dereferencing URLs, a DID document usually contains cryptographic material enabling authentication of the DID subject. 

##  Generic DID Syntax

The generic DID scheme is a URI scheme conformant with [[!RFC3986]]. The DID
scheme specializes only the scheme and authority components of a DID URL. The
`path-abempty`, `query`, and `fragment` components are identical to the ABNF
rules defined in [[!RFC3986]].

The term DID refers only to the URI conforming to the `did` rule in the ABNF
below. A DID always identifies the DID subject. The term DID URL, defined by
the `did-url` rule, refers to a URL that begins with a DID followed by one or
more additional components. A DID URL always identifies the resource to be
located.

The following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [[!RFC5234]], which
defines `ALPHA` and `DIGIT`. All other rule names not defined in this ABNF are
defined in [[RFC3986]].

    
    
    did                = "did:" method-name ":" method-specific-id
    method-name        = 1*method-char
    method-char        = %x61-7A / DIGIT
    method-specific-id = *idchar *( ":" *idchar )
    idchar             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_"
    did-url            = did *( ";" param ) path-abempty [ "?" query ]
                         [ "#" fragment ]
    param              = param-name [ "=" param-value ]
    param-name         = 1*param-char
    param-value        = *param-char
    param-char         = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_" / ":" /
                         pct-encoded
          

The grammar currently allows an empty `method-specific-id`, e.g.,
`did:example:` would be a valid DID that could identify the DID method itself.

##  Method-Specific Syntax

A DID method specification MUST further restrict the generic DID syntax by
defining its own `method-name` and its own `method-specific-id` syntax. For
more information, see Section .

##  Generic DID Parameter Names

The DID URL syntax supports a simple, generalized format for parameters based
on the matrix parameter syntax ([[MATRIX-URIS]]). The ABNF above specifies the
basic syntax (the `param-name` rule) but does not specify any concrete
parameter names.

Some generic DID parameter names (for example, for service selection) are
completely independent of any specific DID method and MUST always function the
same way for all DIDs. Other DID parameter names (for example, for versioning)
MAY be supported by certain DID methods, but MUST operate uniformly across
those DID methods that do support them.

Parameter names that are completely method-specific are described in Section .

The following table defines a set of generic DID parameter names.

Generic DID Parameter Name  |  Description  
---|---  
`hl` |  A resource hash of the DID document to add integrity protection, as
specified in [[HASHLINK]].  
`service` |  Identifies a service from the DID document by service ID.  
`version-id` |  Identifies a specific version of a DID document to be resolved
(the version ID could be sequential, or a UUID, or method-specific). Note that
this parameter might not be supported by all DID methods.  
`version-time` |  Identifies a certain version timestamp of a DID document to
be resolved. That is, the DID document that was valid for a DID at a certain
time. Note that this parameter might not be supported by all DID methods.  
  
The exact processing rules for these parameters are specified in [[DID-
RESOLUTION]].

Adding a DID parameter to a DID URL means that the parameter becomes part of
an identifier for a resource (the DID document or other). Alternatively, the
DID resolution and the DID URL dereferencing processes can also be influenced
by passing options to a DID resolver that are not part of the DID URL. Such
options could for example control caching or the desired encoding of a
resolution result. This is comparable to HTTP, where certain parameters could
either be included in an HTTP URL, or alternatively passed as HTTP headers
during the dereferencing process. The important distinction is that DID
parameters that are part of the DID URL should be used to specify _what
resource is being identified_ , whereas DID resolver options that are not part
of the DID URL should be use to control _how that resource is dereferenced_.

DID parameters MAY be used if there is a clear use case where the parameter
needs to be part of a URI that can be used as a link, or as a resource in RDF
/ JSON-LD documents.

DID parameters SHOULD NOT be used if there are already other, equivalent ways
of constructing URIs that fulfill the same purpose (for example, using other
syntactical constructs such as URI query strings or URI fragments).

DID parameters SHOULD NOT be used if the same functionality can be expressed
by passing options to a DID resolver, and if there is no need to construct a
URI for use as a link, or as a resource in RDF / JSON-LD documents.

##  Method-Specific DID Parameter Names

A DID method specification MAY specify additional method-specific parameter
names. A method-specific parameter name MUST be prefixed by the method name,
as defined by the `method-name` rule.

For example, if the method `did:foo:` defines the parameter bar, the parameter
name must be `foo:bar`. An example DID URL using this method and this method-
specific parameter would be as shown below.

    
    
    did:foo:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;foo:bar=high
          

Consider using kebab-case style instead of colon separator, e.g., `foo-bar`
instead of `foo:bar`.

A method-specific parameter name defined by one DID method MAY be used by
other DID methods.

    
    
    did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;foo:bar=low
          

Method-specific parameter names MAY be combined with generic parameter names
in any order.

    
    
    did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;service=agent;foo:bar=high
          

Both DID method namespaces and method-specific parameter namespaces MAY
include colons, so they might be partitioned hierarchically, as defined by a
DID method specification. The following example DID URL illustrates both.

    
    
    did:foo:baz:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp;foo:baz:hex=b612
          

Review what exactly we want to say about method-specific parameters defined by
one method but used in a DID URL with a different method. Also discuss
hierarchical method namespaces in DID parameter names.

##  Path

A generic DID path is identical to a URI path and MUST conform to the `path-
abempty` ABNF rule in [[!RFC3986]]. A DID path SHOULD be used to address
resources available through a service endpoint. For more information, see
Section .

A specific DID scheme MAY specify ABNF rules for DID paths that are more
restrictive than the generic rules in this section.

    
    
    did:example:123456/path
          

##  Query

A generic DID query is identical to a URI query and MUST conform to the
`query` ABNF rule in [[!RFC3986]]. A DID query SHOULD be used to address
resources available through a service endpoint. For more information, see
Section .

A specific DID scheme MAY specify ABNF rules for DID queries that are more
restrictive than the generic rules in this section.

    
    
    did:example:123456?query=true
          

##  Fragment

A generic DID fragment is identical to a URI fragment and MUST conform to the
`fragment` ABNF rule in [[RFC3986]]. Implementers are strongly discouraged
from using a DID fragment for anything other than a method-independent
reference into the DID document to identify a component of a DID document (for
example, a unique public key description or service endpoint). To resolve this
reference, the complete DID URL including the DID fragment MUST be used as
input to the DID URL dereferencing algorithm for the target component in the
DID document object. For more information, see [[DID-RESOLUTION]].

A specific DID scheme MAY specify ABNF rules for DID fragments that are more
restrictive than the generic rules in this section.

Implementations need not rely on graph-based processing of DID documents to
locate metadata contained in the DID document when the DID includes a DID
fragment. Tree-based processing can be used instead.

Implementations SHOULD NOT prevent the use of JSON Pointer ([[!RFC6901]]).

    
    
    did:example:123456#oidc
          

##  Normalization

For the broadest interoperability, make DID normalization as simple and
universal as possible:

  * The DID scheme name MUST be lowercase. 
  * The DID method name MUST be lowercase. 
  * Case sensitivity and normalization of the value of the `method-specific-id` rule in Section  MUST be defined by the governing DID method specification. 

##  Persistence

A DID is expected to be persistent and immutable. That is, a DID is bound
exclusively and permanently to its one and only subject. Even after a DID is
deactivated, it is intended that it never be repurposed.

Ideally, a DID would be a completely abstract decentralized identifier (like a
UUID) that could be bound to multiple underlying DID registries over time,
thus maintaining its persistence independent of any particular system.
However, registering the same identifier on multiple DID registries introduces
extremely hard entityship and [start-of-
authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types%23SOA) (SOA)
problems. It also greatly increases implementation complexity for developers.

To avoid these issues, it is RECOMMENDED that DID method specifications only
produce DIDs and DID methods bound to strong, stable DID registries capable of
making the highest level of commitment to persistence of the DID and DID
method over time.

Although not included in this version, future versions of this specification
might support a DID document `equivID` property to establish verifiable
equivalence relations between DIDs representing the same subject on multiple
DID registries. Such equivalence relations can produce the practical
equivalent of a single persistent abstract DID. For more information, see
Section .

#  DID Documents

A DID points to a DID document. DID documents are the serialization of the
data model outlined in Section . The following sections define the properties
in a DID document, including whether these properties are required or
optional.

##  Contexts

When two software systems need to exchange data, they need to use terminology
and a protocol that both systems understand. The `@context` property ensures
that two systems operating on the same DID document are using mutually agreed
terminology.

DID documents MUST include the `@context` property.

More information about the [JSON-LD Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-
ld/#the-context) in general can be found in the [[JSON-LD]] specification.

@context

     The value of the `@context` property MUST be one or more URIs, where the value of the first URI is `https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1`. If more than one URI is provided, the URIs MUST be interpreted as an ordered set. It is RECOMMENDED that dereferencing each URI results in a document containing machine-readable information about the context. 
    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"
    }
          

DID method specifications MAY define their own JSON-LD contexts. However, it
is NOT RECOMMENDED to define a new context unless the context is necessary to
properly implement the method. Method-specific contexts MUST NOT override the
terms defined in the generic DID context.

##  DID Subject

The DID subject is denoted with the `id` property. The DID subject is the
entity that the DID document is about. That is, it is the entity identified by
the DID and described by the DID document.

DID documents MUST include the `id` property.

id

     The value of `id` MUST be a single valid DID. 
    
    
    {
      "id": "did:example:21tDAKCERh95uGgKbJNHYp"
    }
          

DID method specifications can create intermediate representations of a DID
document that do not contain the `id` key, such as when a DID resolver is
performing resolution. However, the fully resolved DID document always
contains a valid `id` property. The value of `id` in the resolved DID document
is expected to match the DID that was resolved.

##  Public Keys

A public key is a verification method. Public keys are used for digital
signatures, encryption and other cryptographic operations, which in turn are
the basis for purposes such as authentication (see Section ) or establishing
secure communication with service endpoints (see Section ). As well, public
keys can play a role in authorization mechanisms of DID CRUD operations (see
Section ), which can be defined by DID method specifications.

A public key is just one type of verification method. A DID document expresses
the relationship between the DID subject and a verification method using a
verification relationship. Examples of verification relationships include:
`authentication`, ` capabilityInvocation`, `capabilityDelegation`,
`keyAgreement`, and `assertionMethod`. A DID controller MUST be explicit about
the verification relationship between the DID subject and the verification
method. Verification methods that are not associated with a particular
verification relationship MUST NOT be used for that verification relationship.
See Section  for a more detailed example of a verification relationship.

A DID document MAY include a `publicKey` property.

publicKey

     If a DID document includes a `publicKey` property, the value of the property MUST be an array of public key objects. Each public key object MUST have the `type`, `controller`, and specific public key properties, and SHOULD have an `id` property. The public key objects MAY include additional properties. 

The value of the `id` property, if present, MUST be a URI. The array of public
keys MUST NOT contain multiple entries with the same `id`. In this case, a DID
document processor MUST produce an error.

The value of the `type` property MUST be exactly one public key type. For a
registry of available key types and formats, see Appendix .

The value of the `controller` property, which identifies the controller of the
corresponding private key, MUST be a valid DID.

The semantics of the `controller` property are the same when the subject of
the relationship is the DID document as when the subject of the relationship
is a key. Since a key can't control itself, and the key controller cannot be
inferred from the DID document, it is necessary to explicitly express the
identity of the controller of the key (which may be the DID controller or DID
subject). The difference is that the value of `controller` on a key is not
necessarily a DID controller. DID controller(s) are expressed using the
`controller` property on the top level of the DID document; see Section .

All public key properties MUST be from the Linked Data Cryptographic Suite
Registry. For a registry of key types and formats, see Appendix .

If a public key does not exist in the DID document, it MUST be assumed the key
was revoked or is invalid. The DID document MAY contain revoked keys. A DID
document containing a revoked key MUST also contain or refer to the revocation
information for the key (for example, a revocation list). Each DID method
specification is expected to detail how revocation is performed and tracked.

Public keys of all types MUST be expressed in either JSON Web Key (JWK) format
using the `publicKeyJwk` property or one of the formats listed in the table
below. Public key expression MUST NOT use any other key format.

The Working Group is still debating whether the base encoding format used will
be Base58 (Bitcoin) [[BASE58]], base64url [[RFC7515]], or base16 (hex)
[[RFC4648]]. The entries in the table below currently assume PEM and Base58
(Bitcoin), but might change to base64url and/or base16 (hex) after the group
achieves consensus on this particular issue.

The Working Group is still debating whether secp256k1 Schnorr public key
values will be elaborated upon in this specification and if so, how they will
be expressed and encoded.

Key Type  |  Support  
---|---  
RSA  |  RSA public key values MUST either be encoded as a JWK or be encoded in
Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format using the `publicKeyPem` property.  
ed25519  |  Ed25519 public key values MUST either be encoded as a JWK or be
encoded as the raw 32-byte public key value in Base58 Bitcoin format using the
`publicKeyBase58` property.  
secp256k1-koblitz  |  Secp256k1 Koblitz public key values MUST either be
encoded as a JWK or be encoded as the raw 33-byte public key value in Base58
Bitcoin format using the `publicKeyBase58` property.  
secp256r1  |  Secp256r1 public key values MUST either be encoded as a JWK or
be encoded as the raw 32-byte public key value encoded in Base58 Bitcoin
format using the `publicKeyBase58` property.  
Curve25519  |  Curve25519 (also known as X25519) public key values MUST either
be encoded as a JWK or be encoded as the raw 32-byte public key value in
Base58 Bitcoin format using the `publicKeyBase58` property.  
  
Example:

    
    
    {
      "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1", "https://w3id.org/security/v1"],
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "publicKey": [{
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        "type": "RsaVerificationKey2018",
        "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
        "controller": "did:example:pqrstuvwxyz0987654321",
        "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-3",
        "type": "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",
        "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyHex": "02b97c30de767f084ce3080168ee293053ba33b235d7116a3263d29f1450936b71"
      }],
      ...
    }
          

A key MAY be _embedded_ or _referenced_ in a DID document. For example, the
`authentication` property might refer to keys in both ways, as shown in the
example below.

    
    
    {
    ...
    
      "authentication": [
        // this key is referenced, it may be used for more than one proof purpose
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        // this key is embedded and may *only* be used for authentication
        {
          "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
          "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
          "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
          "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        }
      ],
    
    ...
    }
          

The steps to use when processing a `publicKey` property in a DID document are:

  1. Let _value_ be the data associated with the `publicKey` property and initialize _result_ to `null`. 
  2. If _value_ is an object, the key material is embedded. Set _result_ to _value_. 
  3. If _value_ is a string, the key is included by reference. Assume _value_ is a URL. 
    1. Dereference the URL and retrieve the `publicKey` properties associated with the URL. For example, process the `publicKey` property at the top-level of the dereferenced document. 
    2. Iterating through each public key object, if the `id` property of the object matches _value_ , set _result_ to the object. 
  4. If _result_ does not contain at least the `id`, `type`, and `controller` properties, as well as any mandatory public cryptographic material, as determined by the `type` property of _result_ , throw an error. 

Caching and expiration of the keys in a DID document is entirely the
responsibility of DID resolvers and other clients. For more information, see
Section .

##  Authentication

Authentication is a mechanism by which an entity can prove it is the DID
subject. The _verifier_ of an authentication attempt can check if the
authenticating party is presenting a valid proof of authentication, that is,
that they are who they say they are. Note that a successful authentication on
its own may or may not confer authority; that is up to the verifying
application.

If authentication is established, it is up to the DID method or other
application to decide what to do with that information. A particular DID
method could decide that authenticating as a DID controller is sufficient to,
for example, update or delete the DID document. Another DID method could
require different keys, or a different verification method entirely, to be
presented in order to update or delete the DID document than that used to
authenticate. In other words, what is done _after_ the authentication check is
out of scope for the DID data model, but DID methods and applications are
expected to define this themselves.

A DID document MAY include an `authentication` property.

authentication

     The `authentication` property is a relationship between the DID subject and a set of verification methods (such as, but not limited to, public keys). It means that the DID subject has authorized some set of verification methods (per the value of the `authentication` property) for the purpose of authentication. The value of the `authentication` property SHOULD be an array of verification methods. Each verification method MAY be embedded or referenced. An example of a verification method is a public key (see Section ). 

This statement is useful to any "authentication verifier" that needs to check
to see if an entity that is attempting to authenticate is, in fact, presenting
a valid proof of authentication. When a verifier receives some data (in some
protocol-specific format) that contains a proof that was made for the purpose
of "authentication", and that says that an entity is identified by the DID,
then that verifier checks to ensure that the proof can be verified using a
verification method (e.g., public key) listed under `authentication` in the
DID Document.

The verification method indicated by the `authentication` property of a DID
document can only be used to authenticate the DID subject. To authenticate the
DID controller (in cases where the DID controller is not _also_ the DID
subject) the entity associated with the value of `controller` (see Section )
needs to authenticate itself with its _own_ DID document and attached
`authentication` verification method relationship.

Example:

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "authentication": [
        // this method can be used to authenticate as did:...fghi
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        // this method can be used to authenticate as did:...fghi
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#biometric-1",
        // this method is *only* authorized for authentication, it may not
        // be used for any other proof purpose, so its full description is
        // embedded here rather than using only a reference
        {
          "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
          "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
          "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
          "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        }
      ],
      ...
    }
          

##  Authorization and Delegation

Authorization is the mechanism used to state how operations may be performed
on behalf of the DID subject. Delegation is the mechanism that the subject
uses to authorize others to act on their behalf.

Note that Authorization is separate from . This is particularly important for
key recovery in the case of key loss, when the subject no longer has access to
their keys, or key compromise, where the DID controller's trusted third
parties need to override malicious activity by an attacker. See Section .

A DID document MAY include a `controller` property to indicate that there are
DID controller(s) other than the DID subject. If so:

controller

     The value of the `controller` property MUST be a valid DID or an array of valid DIDs. The corresponding DID document(s) SHOULD contain authorization relations that explicitly permit the use of certain verification methods for specific purposes. 

Each DID method MUST define how authorization and delegation are implemented,
including any necessary cryptographic operations.

There are at least two suggested methods for implementing Authorization and
Delegation, which may be layered:

  * A DID registry could implement a coarse-grained `controller` pattern by enabling DID documents to express the DID of another DID controller that controls it, or additionally, 
  * A DID registry could implement a capabilities-based approach enabling further fine-grained control of authorization and delegation. 

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "controller": "did:example:bcehfew7h32f32h7af3",
      "service": [{
        // used to retrieve Verifiable Credentials associated with the DID
        "type": "VerifiableCredentialService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/vc/"
      }]
    }
            

##  Service Endpoints

One of the primary purposes of a DID document is to enable discovery of
service endpoints. A service endpoint can be any type of service the DID
subject wants to advertise, including decentralized identity management
services for further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction.

A DID document MAY include a `service` property.

service

     If a DID document includes a `service` property, the value of the property SHOULD be an array of service endpoint objects. Each service endpoint MUST have `type` and `serviceEndpoint` properties, SHOULD have an `id` property, and MAY include additional properties. 

The value of the `id` property (if present) MUST be a URI. The array of
service endpoints MUST NOT contain multiple entries with the same `id`. In
this case, a DID document processor MUST produce an error.

The value of the `serviceEndpoint` property MUST be a JSON-LD object or a
valid URI conforming to [[RFC3986]] and normalized according to the rules in
section 6 of [[RFC3986]] and to any normalization rules in its applicable URI
scheme specification.

It is expected that the service endpoint protocol is published in an open
standard specification.

    
    
    {
      "service": [{
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#openid",
        "type": "OpenIdConnectVersion1.0Service",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://openid.example.com/"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vcr",
        "type": "CredentialRepositoryService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://repository.example.com/service/8377464"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#xdi",
        "type": "XdiService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://xdi.example.com/8377464"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#agent",
        "type": "AgentService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://agent.example.com/8377464"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#hub",
        "type": "IdentityHub",
        "publicKey": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1",
        "serviceEndpoint": {
          "@context": "https://schema.identity.foundation/hub",
          "type": "UserHubEndpoint",
          "instances": ["did:example:456", "did:example:789"]
        }
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#messages",
        "type": "MessagingService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/messages/8377464"
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#inbox",
        "type": "SocialWebInboxService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://social.example.com/83hfh37dj",
        "description": "My public social inbox",
        "spamCost": {
          "amount": "0.50",
          "currency": "USD"
        }
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#authpush",
        "type": "DidAuthPushModeVersion1",
        "serviceEndpoint": "http://auth.example.com/did:example:123456789abcdefg"
      }]
    }
          

For more information about security considerations regarding authentication
service endpoints see Sections  and .

##  Created

A DID document SHOULD include a `created` property.

created

     If a DID document includes a `created` property, the value of the property MUST be a valid XML datetime value, as defined in section 3.3.7 of [W3C XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) 1.1 Part 2: Datatypes](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/) [[!XMLSCHEMA11-2]]. This datetime value MUST be normalized to UTC 00:00, as indicated by the trailing "Z". 
    
    
    {
      "created": "2002-10-10T17:00:00Z"
    }
          

##  Updated

Standard metadata for identifier records includes a timestamp of the most
recent change.

A DID document SHOULD include an `updated` property.

updated

     If a DID document includes an `updated` property, the value of the property MUST follow the same formatting rules as the `created` property, as outlined in Section . 
    
    
    {
      "updated": "2016-10-17T02:41:00Z"
    }
          

##  Proof

A `proof` on a DID document is cryptographic proof of the integrity of the DID
document according to either the:

  * DID subject, as defined in Section 
  * DID controller, as defined in Section , if present. 

This proof is NOT proof of the binding between a DID and a DID document. For
more information, see Section .

A DID document MAY include a `proof` property.

proof

     If a DID document includes a `proof` property, the value of the property MUST be a valid JSON-LD proof, as defined by [Linked Data Proofs](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/). 
    
    
    {
      "proof": {
        "type": "LinkedDataSignature2015",
        "created": "2016-02-08T16:02:20Z",
        "creator": "did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1ja#keys-1",
        "signatureValue": "QNB13Y7Q9...1tzjn4w=="
      }
    }
          

##  Extensibility

One of the goals of the decentralized identifiers data model is to enable
permissionless innovation. The data model needs to be extensible in a number
of different ways, including:

  * Modelling of complex multi-entity relationships is provided through the use of a graph-based data model. 
  * Extending the machine-readable vocabularies used to describe information in the data model, without relying on a centralized system, is accomplished through the use of [[LINKED-DATA]]. 
  * Support for multiple types of cryptographic proof formats is accomplished through the use of Linked Data Proofs [[LD-PROOFS]], Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]], and a variety of signature suites. 
  * All of the extensibility mechanisms outlined above are provided in a data format that is popular among software developers and web page authors and is enabled through the use of [[!JSON-LD]]. 

This approach to data modeling is often called an _open worldassumption_ ,
meaning that anyone can say anything about any other thing. This approach
often seems in conflict with building simple and predictable software systems.
Balancing extensibility with program correctness is always more challenging
with an open world assumption than it is with closed software systems.

The rest of this section describes how both extensibility and program
correctness are achieved through a series of examples.

Let us assume that we start with the following DID document.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://example.org/example-method/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "publicKey": [{ ... }],
      "authentication": [{ ... }],
      "service": [{ ... }]
    }
          

The contents of the `publicKey`, `authentication`, and `service` properties
are not important for the purpose of this section. What is important is that
the object above is a valid DID document. Now assume that a developer wants to
extend the DID document to express an additional piece of information, the
subject's public photo stream.

The first thing that a developer would do is create a JSON-LD Context
containing the new term.

    
    
    {
      "@context": {
        "PhotoStreamService": "https://example.com/vocab#PhotoStreamService"
      }
    }
          

Now that the JSON-LD Context is created, the developer MUST publish it
somewhere that is accessible to any DID document processor. For this example,
assume that the JSON-LD Context above is published at
`did:example:contexts:987654321`. At this point, extending the first example
in this section is just a matter of including the context above and adding the
new property to the DID document.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://example.org/example-method/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "authentication": [ ... ],
      "service": [{
        "@context": "did:example:contexts:987654321",
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#photos",
        "type": "PhotoStreamService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.org/photos/379283"
      }]
    }
          

The examples so far show that it is easy to extend the decentralized
identifiers data model in a permissionless and decentralized way. The
mechanism also ensures that decentralized identifiers created in this way
prevent namespace conflicts and semantic ambiguity.

An extensibility model this dynamic does increase the implementation burden.
Software written for such a system needs to determine if accepting DID
documents with extensions is acceptable based on the risk profile of the
application. Some applications might choose to accept but ignore extensions,
others might choose to only accept certain extensions, while highly secure
environments might disallow extensions. These decisions are up to the
application developers and are specifically not the domain of this
specification.

Implementations MUST produce an error when an extension JSON-LD Context
overrides the expanded URL for a term specified in this specification. To
avoid the possibility of accidentally overriding terms, developers SHOULD
scope their extensions. For example, the following extension scopes the new
`PhotoStreamService` term so that it can only be used within the `service`
property:

    
    
    {
      "@context": {
        "service": {
          "@id": "https://w3id.org/did#service",
          "@context": {
            "PhotoStreamService": "https://example.com/vocab#PhotoStreamService"
          }
        }
      }
    }
          

Developers are urged to ensure that extension JSON-LD Contexts are highly
available. Implementations that cannot fetch a context will produce an error.
Strategies for ensuring that extension JSON-LD Contexts are always available
include using content-addressed URLs for contexts, bundling context documents
with implementations, or enabling aggressive caching of contexts.

#  DID Document Syntax

A DID document MUST be a single JSON object conforming to [[!RFC8259]]. Many
of the concepts in this document were introduced by example using the JSON-LD
syntax, a format for mapping JSON data into the RDF semantic graph model, as
defined by [[!JSON-LD]]. This section formalizes how the data model (described
in Sections  and ) is realized in JSON-LD.

Although syntactic mappings are provided for JSON and JSON-LD only,
applications and services can use any other data representation syntax, such
as JXD (JSON XDI Data, a serialization format for the [XDI graph
model](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xdi/xdi-core/v1.0/csd01/xdi-
core-v1.0-csd01.xml)), XML, YAML, or CBOR, that is capable of expressing the
data model.

##  JSON

The data model, as described in Section , can be encoded in Javascript Object
Notation (JSON) [[RFC8259]] by mapping property values to JSON types as
follows:

  * Numeric values representable as IEEE754 SHOULD be represented as a Number type. 
  * Boolean values SHOULD be represented as a Boolean type. 
  * Sequence value SHOULD be represented as an Array type. 
  * Unordered sets of values SHOULD be represented as an Array type. 
  * Sets of properties SHOULD be represented as an Object type. 
  * Empty values SHOULD be represented as a null value. 
  * Other values MUST be represented as a String type. 

##  JSON-LD

[[!JSON-LD]] is a JSON-based format used to serialize [Linked
Data](http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data). The syntax is designed
to easily integrate into deployed systems already using JSON, and provides a
smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily intended to be a way
to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build
interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage
engines.

JSON-LD is useful when extending the data model described in this
specification. Instances of the data model are encoded in JSON-LD in the same
way they are encoded in JSON (see Section ), with the addition of the
`@context` property. The [JSON-LD Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-
context) is described in detail in the [[!JSON-LD]] specification and its use
is elaborated on in Section .

In general, the data model and syntaxes described in this document are
designed such that developers can copy and paste examples into their software
systems. The design goal of this approach is to provide a low barrier to entry
while still ensuring global interoperability between a heterogeneous set of
software systems. This section describes some of these approaches, which will
likely go unnoticed by most developers, but whose details will be of interest
to implementers. Noteworthy features provided by JSON-LD are:

  * The `@id` and `@type` keywords are aliased to `id` and `type` respectively, enabling developers to use this specification as idiomatic JSON. 
  * Data types, such as integers, dates, units of measure, and URLs, are automatically typed to provide stronger type guarantees for use cases that require them. 
  * The `@protected` properties feature of JSON-LD 1.1 is used to ensure that terms defined by this specification cannot be overridden. This means that as long as the same `@context` declaration is made at the top of a DID document, interoperability is guaranteed between implementations that use a JSON-LD processor and implementations that do not. 

#  DID Methods

##  DID Method Schemes

A DID method specification MUST define exactly one method-specific DID scheme,
identified by exactly one method name. For more information, see the `method-
name` rule in Section .

Because the method name is part of the DID, short method names are preferred;
the method name SHOULD be five characters or less. The method name might
reflect the name of the DID registry to which the DID method specification
applies. For more information, see Section .

The DID method specification for the method-specific DID scheme MUST specify
how to generate the `method-specific-id` component of a DID. The `method-
specific-id` value MUST be able to be generated without the use of a
centralized registry service. The `method-specific-id` value SHOULD be
globally unique by itself. The DID, as defined by the `did` rule in Section ,
MUST be globally unique.

If needed, a method-specific DID scheme MAY define multiple `method-specific-
id` formats. It is RECOMMENDED that a method-specific DID scheme define as few
`method-specific-id` formats as possible.

##  DID Operations

To enable the full functionality of DIDs and DID documents on a particular DID
registry, a DID method specification MUST specify how each of the following
CRUD operations is performed by a client. Each operation ought to be specified
to the level of detail necessary to build and test interoperable client
implementations with the DID registry. These operations can effectively be
used to perform all the operations required of a CKMS (cryptographic key
management system), e.g.: key registration, key replacement, key rotation, key
recovery, and key expiration.

Any DID method specification that does not support a specific operation, such
as update or deactivate, MUST clearly state these limitations.

Determining the authority of a party to carry out the operations is method-
specific. For example, a DID method MAY:

  * use the verification methods listed under authentication to decide whether an update/deactivate operation is allowed; or 
  * use other constructs in the DID Document to decide this, for example, a verification method specified under capabilityInvocation could be used to verify the invocation of a capability to update the DID Document.; or 
  * not use the DID Document at all to decide this, but have rules that are are "built into" the method. 

###  Create

The DID method specification MUST specify how a client creates a DID and its
associated DID document on the DID registry, including all cryptographic
operations necessary to establish proof of control.

###  Read/Verify

The DID method specification MUST specify how a client uses a DID to request a
DID document from the DID registry, including how the client can verify the
authenticity of the response.

###  Update

The DID method specification MUST specify how a client can update a DID
document on the DID registry, including all cryptographic operations necessary
to establish proof of control, _or_ state that updates are not possible.

###  Deactivate

The DID method specification MUST specify how a client can deactivate a DID on
the DID registry, including all cryptographic operations necessary to
establish proof of deactivation, _or_ state that deactivation is not possible.

##  Unique DID Method Names

The authors of a new DID method specification SHOULD use a method name that is
unique among all DID method names known to them at the time of publication.

Because there is no central authority for allocating or approving DID method
names, there is no way to know for certain if a specific DID method name is
unique. To help with this challenge, the [W3C Credentials Community
Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/) maintains a non-
authoritative list of known DID method names and their associated
specifications. For more information, see Appendix .

The [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] is a tool for implementors to use when coming to
consensus on a new method name, as well as an informative reference for
software developers implementing DID resolvers for different DID methods. For
more information about DID resolvers see Section . The [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]]
is not a definitive or official list of DID methods. Nonetheless, adding DID
method names to the [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] is encouraged so that other
implementors and members of the community have a place to see an overview of
existing DID methods. The lightweight criteria for inclusion are documented in
the [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]].

##  Security requirements

Discussions at Rebooting the Web of Trust 5 resulted in consensus to move
Authorization to DID method specifications. It is currently expected that
there will be an attempt to create a generalized authorization mechanism that
is build on object capabilities.

DID method specifications MUST include their own Security Considerations
sections. This section MUST consider all the requirements mentioned in section
5 of [[RFC3552]] (page 27) for the DID operations defined in the
specification.

At least the following forms of attack MUST be considered: eavesdropping,
replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle.
Potential denial of service attacks MUST be identified as well.

If the protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, the DID
method specification MUST clearly indicate which portions of the data are
protected and what the protections are, and SHOULD give an indication to what
sorts of attacks the cryptographic protection is susceptible. For example,
integrity only, confidentiality, endpoint authentication, and so on.

Data which is to be held secret (keying material, random seeds, and so on)
SHOULD be clearly labeled.

If the technology involves authentication, particularly user-host
authentication, the security of the authentication method MUST be clearly
specified.

This section MUST discuss, per Section 5 of [[RFC3552]], residual risks (such
as the risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation,
or cipher) after threat mitigation was deployed.

This section MUST provide integrity protection and update authentication for
all operations required by Section .

Where DID methods make use of peer-to-peer computing resources, such as with
all known DLTs, the expected burdens of those resources SHOULD be discussed in
relation to denial of service.

Method-specific endpoint authentication MUST be discussed. Where DID methods
make use of DLTs with varying network topology, sometimes offered as _light
node_ or _[thin client](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security)_
implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security
assumptions of the topology available to implementations of the DID method
MUST be discussed.

DID methods MUST discuss the policy mechanism by which DIDs are proven to be
uniquely assigned. A DID fits the functional definition of a URN, as defined
in [[RFC8141]]. That is, a DID is a persistent identifier that is assigned
once to a resource and never reassigned to a different resource. This is
particularly important in a security context because a DID might be used to
identify a specific party subject to a specific set of authorization rights.

DID methods that introduce new authentication service endpoint types (see
Section ) SHOULD consider the security requirements of the supported
authentication protocol.

##  Privacy Requirements

DID method specifications MUST include their own Privacy Considerations
sections, if only to point to .

The DID method specification's Privacy Considerations section MUST discuss any
subsection of section 5 of [[RFC6973]] that could apply in a method-specific
manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored data compromise,
unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation, identification, secondary
use, disclosure, exclusion.

#  DID Resolvers

A DID resolver is a software or hardware component with an API for resolving
DIDs of at least one DID method. It executes the read operation for the DID
method corresponding to the DID being resolved to obtain the authoritative DID
document. For more information, see Section .

The interfaces and algorithms for resolving DIDs and dereferencing DID URLs
are specified in [[DID-RESOLUTION]].

#  Security Considerations

During the Working Draft stage, this section focuses on security topics that
should be important in early implementations. The editors are seeking feedback
on threats and threat mitigations that should be reflected in this section or
elsewhere in the spec. DIDs are designed to operate under the general Internet
threat model used by many IETF standards. We assume uncompromised endpoints,
but anticipate that messages could be read or corrupted on the network.
Protecting against an attack when a system is compromised requires external
key-signing hardware (see Section ).

##  Choosing DID Resolvers

The [[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] is an informative list of DID method names and
their corresponding DID method specifications. Implementors need to bear in
mind that there is no central authority to mandate which DID method
specification is to be used with any specific DID method name, but can use the
[[DID-METHOD-REGISTRY]] to make an informed decision when choosing which DID
resolver implementations to use.

##  Binding of Identity

The following sections describe binding identities to DIDs and DID documents.

###  Proving Control of a DID and DID Document

Signatures are one way to allow DID documents to be cryptographically
verifiable.

By itself, a verified signature on a self-signed DID document does not prove
control of a DID. It only proves that the:

  * DID document was not tampered with since it was registered. 
  * DID controller(s) controlled the private key used for the signature at the time the signature was generated. 

Proving control of a DID, that is, the binding between the DID and the DID
document that describes it, requires a two step process:

  1. Resolving the DID to a DID document according to its DID method specification. 
  2. Verifying that the `id` property of the resulting DID document matches the DID that was resolved. 

It should be noted that this process proves control of a DID and DID document
regardless of whether the DID document is signed.

Signatures on DID documents are optional. DID method specifications SHOULD
explain and specify their implementation if applicable.

It is good practice to combine timestamps with signatures.

###  Proving Control of a Public Key

There are two methods for proving control of the private key corresponding to
a public key description in the DID document: static and dynamic.

The static method is to sign the DID document with the private key. This
proves control of the private key at a time no later than the DID document was
registered. If the DID document is not signed, control of a public key
described in the DID document can still be proven dynamically as follows:

  1. Send a challenge message containing a public key description from the DID document and a nonce to an appropriate service endpoint described in the DID document. 
  2. Verify the signature of the response message against the public key description. 

###  Authentication and Verifiable Claims

A DID and DID document do not inherently carry any
[PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information)
(personally-identifiable information). The process of binding a DID to
something in the real world, such as a person or a company, for example with
credentials with the same subject as that DID, is out of scope for this
specification. For more information, see the [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] instead.

##  Authentication Service Endpoints

If a DID document publishes a service endpoint intended for authentication or
authorization of the DID subject (see Section ), it is the responsibility of
the service endpoint provider, subject, or relying party to comply with the
requirements of the authentication protocols supported at that service
endpoint.

##  Non-Repudiation

Non-repudiation of DIDs and DID document updates is supported under the
assumption that the subject:

  * Is monitoring for unauthorized updates (see Section ). 
  * Has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious updates according to the access control mechanism for the DID method (see Section ). 

Non-repudiation is further supported if timestamps are included (see Sections
and ) and the target DLT system supports timestamps.

##  Notification of DID Document Changes

One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a DID document is monitoring
and actively notifying the DID subject when there are changes. This is
analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to the
email addresses on file. In the case of a DID, where there is no intermediary
registrar or account provider to generate the notification, the following
approaches are suggested:

      * Subscriptions. If the DID registry on which the DID is registered directly supports change notifications, this service can be offered to DID controllers. Notifications could be sent directly to the relevant service endpoints listed in an existing DID. 
      * Self-monitoring. A DID subject can employ their own local or online agent to periodically monitor for changes to a DID document. 
      * Third-party monitoring. A DID subject could rely on a third-party monitoring service, however this introduces another vector of attack. 

##  Key and Signature Expiration

In a decentralized identifier architecture, there are no centralized
authorities to enforce key or signature expiration policies. Therefore DID
resolvers and other client applications need to validate that keys were not
expired at the time they were used. Because some use cases might have
legitimate reasons why already-expired keys can be extended, make sure a key
expiration does not prevent any further use of the key, and implementations of
a resolver ought to be compatible with such extension behavior.

##  Key Revocation and Recovery

Section  specifies the DID operations to be supported by a DID method
specification, including deactivation of a DID document by replacing it with
an updated DID document. In general, checking for key revocation on DLT-based
methods is expected to be handled in a manner similar to checking the balance
of a cryptocurrency account on a distributed ledger. That is, if the balance
is empty, the entire DID is deactivated. DID method specifications are
expected to enable support for a quorum of trusted parties to enable key
recovery. Some of the facilities to do so are suggested in Section . Not all
DID method specifications will recognize control from DIDs registered using
other DID methods and they might restrict third-party control to DIDs that use
the same method. Access control and key recovery in a DID method specification
can also include a time lock feature to protect against key compromise by
maintaining a second track of control for recovery. Further specification of
this type of control is a matter for future work (see Section ).

##  The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers

DIDs achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central registration
authority. This comes, however, at the cost of human memorability. The
algorithms capable of generating globally unique identifiers automatically
produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This
demonstrates the axiom about identifiers described in [Zooko's
Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle): "human-
meaningful, decentralized, secure -- pick any two".

There are of course many use cases where it is desirable to discover a DID
when starting from a human-friendly identifier. For example, a natural
language name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a DID controller,
such as a mobile telephone number, email address, Twitter handle, or blog URL.
However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to DIDs (and doing
so in a way that can be verified and trusted) is outside the scope of this
specification.

Solutions to this problem (and there are many) should be defined in separate
specifications that reference this specification. It is strongly recommended
that such specifications carefully consider the:

      * Numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly identifier for a target entity. 
      * Privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently correlatable, especially if they are globally unique. 

A draft specification for discovering a DID from domain names and email
addresses using DNS lookups is available at [[DNS-DID]].

##  Immutability

Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and the
assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Like any ecosystem, the DID
ecosystem has some potential for this to occur. Because this specification is
focused on a data model instead of a protocol, it offers no opinion about many
aspects of how that model is put to use. However, individual DID methods might
want to consider constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics they
do not need. The more _locked down_ a DID method is, while providing the same
set of features, the less it can be manipulated by malicious actors.

As an example, consider the flexibility that the data model offers with
respect to updating. A single edit to a DID document can change anything and
everything except the root `id` property of the document. And any individual
JSON object in the data model can change all of its properties except its
`id`. But is it actually desirable for a service endpoint to change its `type`
after it is defined? Or for a key to change its value? Or would it be better
to require a new `id` when certain fundamental properties of an object change?
Malicious takeovers of a web site often aim for an outcome where the site
keeps its identifier (the host name), but gets subtle, dangerous changes
underneath. If certain properties of the site were required by the
specification to be immutable (for example, the
[ASN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_\(Internet\)) associated
with its IP address), such attacks might be much harder and more expensive to
carry out, and anomaly detection would be easier.

The notion that immutability provides some cybersecurity benefits is
particularly relevant because of caching. For DID methods tied to a global
source of truth, a direct, just-in-time lookup of the latest version of a DID
document is always possible. However, it seems likely that layers of cache
might eventually sit between a client and that source of truth. If they do,
believing the attributes of an object in the DID document to have a given
state, when they are actually subtly different, might invite exploits. This is
particularly true if some lookups are of a full DID document, and others are
of partial data, where the larger context is assumed.

#  Privacy Considerations

It is critically important to apply the principles of Privacy by Design to all
aspects of the decentralized identifier architecture, because DIDs and DID
documents are, by design, administered directly by the DID controller(s).
There is no registrar, hosting company, or other intermediate service provider
to recommend or apply additional privacy safeguards. The authors of this
specification have applied all seven Privacy by Design principles throughout
its development. For example, privacy in this specification is preventative
not remedial, and privacy is an embedded default. Furthermore, the
decentralized identifier architecture by itself embodies principle #7,
"Respect for user privacy -- keep it user-centric."

This section lists additional privacy considerations that implementers,
delegates, and DID subjects should keep in mind.

##  Keep Personally-Identifiable Information (PII) Private

If a DID method specification is written for a public DID registry where all
DIDs and DID documents are publicly available, it is _critical_ that DID
documents contain no PII. All PII should be kept behind service endpoints
under the control of the DID subject. With this privacy architecture, PII can
be exchanged on a private, peer-to-peer basis using communications channels
identified and secured by public key descriptions in DID documents. This also
enables DID subjects and relying parties to implement the
[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)
[right to be forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten),
because no PII is written to an immutable distributed ledger.

##  DID Correlation Risks and Pseudonymous DIDs

Like any type of globally unique identifier, DIDs might be used for
correlation. DID controllers can mitigate this privacy risk by using pairwise
unique DIDs, that is, sharing a different private DID for every relationship.
In effect, each DID acts as a pseudonym. A pseudonymous DID need only be
shared with more than one party when the DID subject explicitly authorizes
correlation between those parties. If pseudonymous DIDs are the default, then
the only need for a public DID (a DID published openly or shared with a large
number of parties) is when the DID subject explicitly desires public
identification.

##  DID Document Correlation Risks

The anti-correlation protections of pseudonymous DIDs are easily defeated if
the data in the corresponding DID documents can be correlated. For example,
using same public key descriptions or bespoke service endpoints in multiple
DID documents can provide as much correlation information as using the same
DID. Therefore the DID document for a pseudonymous DID also needs to use
pairwise unique public keys. It might seem natural to also use pairwise unique
service endpoints in the DID document for a pseudonymous DID. However, unique
endpoints allow all traffic between two DIDs to be isolated perfectly into
unique buckets, where timing correlation and similar analysis is easy.
Therefore, a better strategy for endpoint privacy might be to share an
endpoint among thousands or millions of DIDs controlled by many different
subjects.

##  Herd Privacy

When a DID subject is indistinguishable from others in the herd, privacy is
available. When the act of engaging privately with another party is by itself
a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished. DIDs and DID methods need
to work to improve herd privacy, particularly for those who legitimately need
it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces that default to preserving
anonymity and pseudonymity. To reduce [digital
fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint), share common
settings across client implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum
on wire protocols, use encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to
standard lengths.

#  Future Work

##  Upper Limits on DID Character Length

The current specification does not take a position on maximum length of a DID.
The maximum interoperable URL length is currently about 2K characters. QR
codes can handle about 4K characters. Clients using DIDs will be responsible
for storing many DIDs, and some methods would be able to externalize some of
their costs onto clients by relying on more complicated signature schemes or
by adding state into DIDs intended for temporary use. A future version of this
specification should set reasonable limits on DID character length to minimize
externalities.

##  Equivalence

Including an equivalence property, such as `equivID`, in DID documents whose
value is an array of DIDs would allow subjects to assert two or more DIDs that
represent the same subject. This capability has numerous uses, including
supporting migration between DID registries and providing forward
compatibility of existing DIDs to future DID registries. In theory, equivalent
DIDs should have the same identifier rights, allowing [verifiable
claims](https://w3c.github.io/vctf/) made against one DID to apply to
equivalent DIDs. Equivalence was not included in the current specification due
to the complexity of verifying equivalence across different DLTs and different
DID methods, and also of aggregating properties of equivalent DID documents.
However equivalence should be supported in a future version of this
specification.

##  Timestamps

Verifiable timestamps have significant utility for identifier records. This is
a good fit for DLTs, since most offer some type of timestamp mechanism.
Despite some transactional cost, they are the most censorship-resistant
transaction ordering systems in the world, so they are nearly ideal for DID
document timestamping. In some cases a DLT's immediate timing is approximate,
however their sense of [ "median time past" (see Bitcoin BIP
113)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki%23Abstract)
can be precisely defined. A generic DID document timestamping mechanism could
would work across all DLTs and might operate via a mechanism including either
individual transactions or transaction batches. The generic mechanism was
deemed out of scope for this version, although it may be included in a future
version of this specification.

##  Time Locks and DID Document Recovery

Section  mentions one possible clever use of time locks to recover control of
a DID after a key compromise. The technique relies on an ability to override
the most recent update to a DID document with Authorization applied by an
earlier version of the DID document in order to defeat the attacker. This
protection depends on adding a [ time lock (see Bitcoin BIP
65)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki%23Abstract)
to protect part of the transaction chain, enabling a Authorization block to be
used to recover control. We plan to add support for time locks in a future
version of this specification.

##  Smart Signatures

Not all DLTs can support the Authorization logic in section . Therefore, in
this version of the specification, all Authorization logic is delegated to DID
method specifications. A potential future solution is a [Smart
Signature](http://www.weboftrust.info/downloads/smart-signatures.pdf)
specification that specifies the code any conformant DLT may implement to
process signature control logic.

##  Verifiable Claims

Although DIDs and DID documents form a foundation for decentralized identity,
they are only the first step in describing their subjects. The rest of the
descriptive power comes through collecting and selectively using [verifiable
claims](https://w3c.github.io/vctf/). Future versions of the specification
will describe in more detail how DIDs and DID document can be integrated with
-- and help enable -- the verifiable claims ecosystem.

##  Alternate Serializations and Graph Models

This version of the specification relies on JSON-LD and the RDF graph model
for expressing a DID document. Future versions of this specification might
specify other semantic graph formats for a DID document.

There are multiple registries that define DID methods and extensions to this
specification. These registries are:

Registry  |  Purpose  
---|---  
[DID Method Registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/) |  Lists
all known DID methods and contains links to their specifications.
