Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables
verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject
(e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that
the controller of the DID decides that it identifies. In contrast to typical,
federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled
from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities.
Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the discovery
of information related to a DID, the design enables the controller of a DID to
prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party. DIDs
are URIs that associate a DID subject with a DID document allowing trustable
interactions associated with that subject.

Each DID document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or
services, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID controller to prove
control of the DID. Services enable trusted interactions associated with the
DID subject. A DID might provide the means to return the DID subject itself,
if the DID subject is an information resource such as a data model.

This document specifies the DID syntax, a common data model, core properties,
serialized representations, DID operations, and an explanation of the process
of resolving DIDs to the resources that they represent.

The W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group has published this document as
a W3C Candidate Recommendation and is requesting that software developers and
DID Method specification authors provide experimental implementations designed
to test the implementability of all of the features in this document.

To exit the W3C Candidate Recommendation phase, the W3C DID Working Group will
require two things: 1) for normative statements that are machine testable, at
least two interoperable implementations per feature, and 2) for normative
statements that are not machine testable, at least two demonstrations of
implementation per feature. A feature is defined as one or more functionally
related normative statements in the specification.

At present, there exist [82 experimental DID Method
specifications](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/#did-methods),
32 experimental DID Method driver implementations, and a Candidate
Recommendation [test suite](https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/) that
determines whether or not a given implementation is conformant with this
specification. Readers are advised to heed the [DID Core
issues](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues) and [ DID Core Test Suite
issues](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues) that each contain the
latest list of concerns and proposed changes that might result in alterations
to this specification.

# Introduction

As individuals and organizations, many of us use globally unique identifiers
in a wide variety of contexts. They serve as communications addresses
(telephone numbers, email addresses, usernames on social media), ID numbers
(for passports, drivers licenses, tax IDs, health insurance), and product
identifiers (serial numbers, barcodes, RFIDs). URIs (Uniform Resource
Identifiers) are used for resources on the Web and each web page you view in a
browser has a globally unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator).

The vast majority of these globally unique identifiers are not under our
control. They are issued by external authorities that decide who or what they
identify and when they can be revoked. They are useful only in certain
contexts and recognized only by certain bodies not of our choosing. They might
disappear or cease to be valid with the failure of an organization. They might
unnecessarily reveal personal information. In many cases, they can be
fraudulently replicated and asserted by a malicious third-party, which is more
commonly known as "identity theft".

The Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) defined in this specification are a new
type of globally unique identifier. They are designed to enable individuals
and organizations to generate their own identifiers using systems they trust.
These new identifiers enable entities to prove control over them by
authenticating using cryptographic proofs such as digital signatures.

Since the generation and assertion of Decentralized Identifiers is entity-
controlled, each entity can have as many DIDs as necessary to maintain their
desired separation of identities, personas, and interactions. The use of these
identifiers can be scoped appropriately to different contexts. They support
interactions with other people, institutions, or systems that require entities
to identify themselves, or things they control, while providing control over
how much personal or private data should be revealed, all without depending on
a central authority to guarantee the continued existence of the identifier.

This specification does not presuppose any particular technology or
cryptography to underpin the generation, persistence, resolution, or
interpretation of DIDs. For example, implementers can create Decentralized
Identifiers based on identifiers registered in federated or centralized
identity management systems. Indeed, almost all types of identifier systems
can add support for DIDs. This creates an interoperability bridge between the
worlds of centralized, federated, and decentralized identifiers. This also
enables implementers to design specific types of DIDs to work with the
computing infrastructure they trust, such as distributed ledgers,
decentralized file systems, distributed databases, and peer-to-peer networks.

This specification is for:

  * Anyone that wants to understand the core architectural principles that are the foundation for Decentralized Identifiers; 
  * Software developers that want to produce and consume Decentralized Identifiers and their associated data formats; 
  * Systems integrators that want to understand how to use Decentralized Identifiers in their software and hardware systems; 
  * Specification authors that want to create new DID infrastructures, known as DID methods, that conform to the ecosystem described by this document. 

## A Simple Example

A DID is a simple text string consisting of three parts: 1) the `did` URI
scheme identifier, 2) the identifier for the DID method, and 3) the DID
method-specific identifier.

are enclosed in a horizontal bracket from above and a label that reads
'scheme'

above the bracket. A gray colon follows the 'did' letters. The middle letters

spell 'example' in magenta, are enclosed in a horizontal bracket from below
and

a label that reads 'DID Method' below the bracket. A gray colon follows the

DID Method. Finally, the letters at the end read '123456789abcdefghijk' in

green, are enclosed in a horizontal bracket from below and a label that

reads 'DID Method Specific String' below the bracket.

## Design Goals

Decentralized Identifiers are a component of larger systems, such as the
Verifiable Credentials ecosystem [[VC-DATA-MODEL]], which influenced the
design goals for this specification. The design goals for Decentralized
Identifiers are summarized here.

Goal  |  Description  
---|---  
Decentralization  |  Eliminate the requirement for centralized authorities or
single point failure in identifier management, including the registration of
globally unique identifiers, public verification keys, services, and other
information.  
Control  |  Give entities, both human and non-human, the power to directly
control their digital identifiers without the need to rely on external
authorities.  
Privacy  |  Enable entities to control the privacy of their information,
including minimal, selective, and progressive disclosure of attributes or
other data.  
Security  |  Enable sufficient security for requesting parties to depend on
DID documents for their required level of assurance.  
Proof-based  |  Enable DID controllers to provide cryptographic proof when
interacting with other entities.  
Discoverability  |  Make it possible for entities to discover DIDs for other
entities, to learn more about or interact with those entities.  
Interoperability  |  Use interoperable standards so DID infrastructure can
make use of existing tools and software libraries designed for
interoperability.  
Portability  |  Be system- and network-independent and enable entities to use
their digital identifiers with any system that supports DIDs and DID methods.  
Simplicity  |  Favor a reduced set of simple features to make the technology
easier to understand, implement, and deploy.  
Extensibility  |  Where possible, enable extensibility provided it does not
greatly hinder interoperability, portability, or simplicity.  
  
##  Architecture Overview

This section provides a basic overview of the major components of
Decentralized Identifier architecture.

![

DIDs and DID documents are recorded on a Verifiable Data Registry; DIDs
resolve

to DID documents; DIDs identify DID subjects; a DID controller controls a DID

document; DID URLs contains a DID; DID URLs dereferenced to DID document

fragments or external resources.

          ](diagrams/did_brief_architecture_overview.svg) Overview of DID architecture and the relationship of the basic components. 

DIDs and DID URLs

     A Decentralized Identifier, or DID, is a URI composed of three parts: the scheme `did:`, a method identifier, and a unique, method-specific identifier specified by the DID method. DIDs are resolvable to DID documents. A DID URL extends the syntax of a basic DID to incorporate other standard URI components such as path, query, and fragment in order to locate a particular resource--for example, a cryptographic public key inside a DID document, or a resource external to the DID document. These concepts are elaborated upon in  and . 
DID subjects

     The subject of a DID is, by definition, the entity identified by the DID. The DID subject might also be the DID controller. Anything can be the subject of a DID: person, group, organization, thing, or concept. This is further defined in . 
DID controllers

     The controller of a DID is the entity (person, organization, or autonomous software) that has the capability--as defined by a DID method--to make changes to a DID document. This capability is typically asserted by the control of a set of cryptographic keys used by software acting on behalf of the controller, though it might also be asserted via other mechanisms. Note that a DID might have more than one controller, and the DID subject can be the DID controller, or one of them. This concept is documented in . 
Verifiable data registries

     In order to be resolvable to DID documents, DIDs are typically recorded on an underlying system or network of some kind. Regardless of the specific technology used, any such system that supports recording DIDs and returning data necessary to produce DID documents is called a verifiable data registry. Examples include distributed ledgers, decentralized file systems, databases of any kind, peer-to-peer networks, and other forms of trusted data storage. This concept is further elaborated upon in . 
DID documents

     DID documents contain information associated with a DID. They typically express verification methods, such as cryptographic public keys, and services relevant to interactions with the DID subject. The generic properties supported in a DID document are specified in . A DID document can be serialized to a byte stream (see ). The properties present in a DID document can be updated according to the applicable operations outlined in . 
DID methods

     DID methods are the mechanism by which a particular type of DID and its associated DID document are created, resolved, updated, and deactivated. DID methods are defined using separate DID method specifications as defined in . 
DID resolvers and DID resolution

     A DID resolver is a system component that takes a DID as input and produces a conforming DID document as output. This process is called DID resolution. The steps for resolving a specific type of DID are defined by the relevant DID method specification. The process of DID resolution is elaborated upon in . 
DID URL dereferencers and DID URL dereferencing

     A DID URL dereferencer is a system component that takes a DID URL as input and produces a resource as output. This process is called DID URL dereferencing. The process of DID URL dereferencing is elaborated upon in . 

This document contains examples that contain JSON, CBOR, and JSON-LD content.
Some of these examples contain characters that are invalid, such as inline
comments (`//`) and the use of ellipsis (`...`) to denote information that
adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to remove this
content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON, CBOR, or JSON-LD.

Some examples contain terms, both property names and values, that are not
defined in this specification. These are indicated with a comment (`//
external (property name|value)`). Such terms, when used in a DID document, are
expected to be registered in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-
REGISTRIES]] with links to both a formal definition and a JSON-LD context.

Interoperability of implementations for DIDs and DID documents is tested by
evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse DIDs and DID
documents that conform to this specification. Interoperability for producers
and consumers of DIDs and DID documents is provided by ensuring the DIDs and
DID documents conform. Interoperability for DID method specifications is
provided by the details in each DID method specification. It is understood
that, in the same way that a web browser is not required to implement all
known URI schemes, conformant software that works with DIDs is not required to
implement all known DID methods. However, all implementations of a given DID
method are expected to be interoperable for that method.

A conforming DID is any concrete expression of the rules specified in  which
complies with relevant normative statements in that section.

A conforming DID document is any concrete expression of the data model
described in this specification which complies with the relevant normative
statements in  and . A serialization format for the conforming document is
deterministic, bi-directional, and lossless, as described in .

A conforming DID method is any specification that complies with the relevant
normative statements in .

A conforming producer is any algorithm realized as software and/or hardware
that generates conforming DIDs or conforming DID Documents. A conforming
producer MUST NOT produce non-conforming DIDs or DID documents.

A conforming consumer is any algorithm realized as software and/or hardware
that consumes conforming DIDs or conforming DID documents. A conforming
consumer MUST produce errors when consuming non-conforming DIDs or DID
documents.

A conforming DID resolver is any algorithm realized as software and/or
hardware that complies with the relevant normative statements in .

A conforming DID URL dereferencer is any algorithm realized as software and/or
hardware that complies with the relevant normative statements in .

## Terminology

In addition to the terminology above, this specification also uses terminology
from the [[INFRA]] specification to formally define the data model. When
[[INFRA]] terminology is used, such as string, ordered set, and map, it is
linked directly to that specification.

## Identifier

This section describes the formal syntax for DIDs and DID URLs. The term
"generic" is used to differentiate the syntax defined here from syntax defined
by _specific_ DID methods in their respective specifications.

### DID Syntax

The generic DID scheme is a URI scheme conformant with [[!RFC3986]]. The ABNF
definition can be found below, which uses the syntax in [[!RFC5234]] and the
corresponding definitions for `ALPHA` and `DIGIT`. All other rule names not
defined in the ABNF below are defined in [[RFC3986]]. All DIDs MUST conform to
the DID Syntax ABNF Rules.

This ABNF does not currently permit an empty `method-specific-id` string. Some
DID methods have expressed an interest in providing resolution of a DID with
an empty `method-specific-id` string, for example to enable discovery of a DID
document describing a verifiable data registry by resolving the DID method
name alone. The Working Group is requesting feedback during the Candidate
Recommendation stage on whether or not an empty `method-specific-id` string is
of interest to implementers. This feature may change as a result of that
feedback. See also [Issue 34](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/34).

The DID Syntax ABNF Rules  
---  
      
    
    did                = "did:" method-name ":" method-specific-id
    method-name        = 1*method-char
    method-char        = %x61-7A / DIGIT
    method-specific-id = *( *idchar ":" ) 1*idchar
    idchar             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_"
                    
  
For requirements on DID methods relating to the DID syntax, see Section .

### DID URL Syntax

A DID URL is a network location identifier for a specific resource. It can be
used to retrieve things like representations of DID subjects, verification
methods, services, specific parts of a DID document, or other resources.

The following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [[!RFC5234]]. It
builds on the `did` scheme defined in . The `path-abempty`, `query`, and
`fragment` components are defined in [[!RFC3986]]. All DID URLs MUST conform
to the DID URL Syntax ABNF Rules. DID methods can further restrict these
rules, as described in .

The DID URL Syntax ABNF Rules  
---  
      
    
    did-url = did path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
                    
  
Although the semicolon (`;`) character can be used according to the rules of
the DID URL syntax, future versions of this specification may use it as a sub-
delimiter for parameters as described in [[?MATRIX-URIS]]]. To avoid future
conflicts, developers ought to refrain from using it.

## Path

A DID path is identical to a generic URI path and conforms to the `path-
abempty` ABNF rule in RFC 3986, section 3.3.

    
    
    did:example:123456/path
            

## Query

A DID query is identical to a generic URI query and conforms to the `query`
ABNF rule in RFC 3986, section 3.4. This syntax feature is elaborated upon in
.

    
    
    did:example:123456?versionId=1
            

## Fragment

DID fragment syntax and semantics are identical to a generic URI fragment and
conforms to the `fragment` ABNF rule in RFC 3986, section 3.5.

A DID fragment is used as a method-independent reference into a DID document
or external resource. Some examples of DID fragment identifiers are shown
below.

    
    
    did:example:123#public-key-0
            
    
    
    did:example:123#agent
            
    
    
    did:example:123?service=agent&relativeRef;=/credentials#degree
            

In order to maximize interoperability, implementers are urged to ensure that
DID fragments are interpreted in the same way across representations (see ).
For example, while JSON Pointer [[?RFC6901]] can be used in a DID fragment, it
will not be interpreted in the same way across non-JSON representations.

Additional semantics for fragment identifiers, which are compatible with and
layered upon the semantics in this section, are described for JSON-LD
representations in . For information about how to dereference a DID fragment,
see .

## DID Parameters

The DID URL syntax supports a simple format for parameters based on the
`query` component described in . Adding a DID parameter to a DID URL means
that the parameter becomes part of the identifier for a resource.

    
    
    did:example:123?versionTime=2021-05-10T17:00:00Z
            
    
    
    did:example:123?service=files&relativeRef;=/resume.pdf
            

Some DID parameters are completely independent of of any specific DID method
and function the same way for all DIDs. Other DID parameters are not supported
by all DID methods. Where optional parameters are supported, they are expected
to operate uniformly across the DID methods that do support them. The
following table provides common DID parameters that function the same way
across all DID methods. Support for all DID Parameters is OPTIONAL.

Parameter Name  |  Description  
---|---  
`service` |  Identifies a service from the DID document by service ID. If
present, the associated value MUST be an ASCII string.  
`relativeRef` |  A relative URI reference according to RFC3986 Section 4.2
that identifies a resource at a service endpoint, which is selected from a DID
document by using the `service` parameter. If present, the associated value
MUST be an ASCII string and MUST use percent-encoding for certain characters
as specified in RFC3986 Section 2.1.  
`versionId` |  Identifies a specific version of a DID document to be resolved
(the version ID could be sequential, or a UUID, or method-specific). If
present, the associated value MUST be an ASCII string.  
`versionTime` |  Identifies a certain version timestamp of a DID document to
be resolved. That is, the DID document that was valid for a DID at a certain
time. If present, the associated value MUST be an ASCII string which is a
valid XML datetime value, as defined in section 3.3.7 of [W3C XML Schema
Definition Language (XSD) 1.1 Part 2:
Datatypes](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/) [[XMLSCHEMA11-2]]. This
datetime value MUST be normalized to UTC 00:00:00 and without sub-second
decimal precision. For example: `2020-12-20T19:17:47Z`.  
`hl` |  A resource hash of the DID document to add integrity protection, as
specified in [[?HASHLINK]]. This parameter is non-normative. If present, the
associated value MUST be an ASCII string.  
  
Implementers as well as DID method specification authors might use additional
DID parameters that are not listed here. For maximum interoperability, it is
RECOMMENDED that DID parameters use the DID Specification Registries mechanism
[[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]], to avoid collision with other uses of the same DID
parameter with different semantics.

DID parameters might be used if there is a clear use case where the parameter
needs to be part of a URL that references a resource with more precision than
using the DID alone. It is expected that DID parameters are _not_ used if the
same functionality can be expressed by passing input metadata to a DID
resolver. Additional considerations for processing these parameters are
discussed in [[?DID-RESOLUTION]].

The DID resolution and the DID URL dereferencing functions can be influenced
by passing input metadata to a DID resolver that are not part of the DID URL
(see ). This is comparable to HTTP, where certain parameters could either be
included in an HTTP URL, or alternatively passed as HTTP headers during the
dereferencing process. The important distinction is that DID parameters that
are part of the DID URL should be used to specify _whatresource is being
identified_, whereas input metadata that is not part of the DID URL should be
use to control _how thatresource is resolved or dereferenced_.

## Relative DID URLs

A relative DID URL is any URL value in a DID document that does not start with
`did:<method-name>:<method-specific-id>`. More specifically, it is any URL
value that does not start with the ABNF defined in . The URL is expected to
reference a resource in the same DID document. Relative DID URLs MAY contain
relative path components, query parameters, and fragment identifiers.

When resolving a relative DID URL reference, the algorithm specified in
RFC3986 Section 5: Reference Resolution MUST be used. The **base URI** value
is the DID that is associated with the DID subject, see . The **scheme** is
`did`. The **authority** is a combination of `<method-name>:<method-specific-
id>`, and the **path** , **query** , and **fragment** values are those defined
in , , and , respectively.

Relative DID URLs are often used to reference verification methods and
services in a DID Document without having to use absolute URLs. DID methods
where storage size is a consideration might use relative URLs to reduce the
storage size of DID documents.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "verificationMethod": [{
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018", // external (property value)
        "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
      }, ...],
      "authentication": [
        // a relative DID URL used to reference a verification method above
        "#key-1"
      ]
    }
            

In the example above, the relative DID URL value will be transformed to an
absolute DID URL value of `did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1`.

# Data Model

This specification defines a data model that can be used to express DID
documents and DID document data structures, which can then be serialized into
multiple concrete representations. This section provides a high-level
description of the data model, how different types of properties are expressed
in the data model, and instructions for extending the data model.

A DID document consists of a map of entries, where each entry consists of a
key/value pair. The DID document data model contains at least two different
classes of entries. The first class of entries is called properties, and is
specified in section . The second class is made up of representation-specific
entries, and is specified in section .

![

Diagram illustrating the entries in the DID document, including properties

and representation-specific entries; some entries are defined by this

specification; others are defined by registered or unregistered
extensions.](diagrams/diagram-did-document-entries.svg) The entries in a DID
document.

All entry keys in the DID document data model are strings. All entry values
are expressed using one of the abstract data types in the table below, and
each representation specifies the concrete serialization format of each data
type.

Data Type  |  Considerations  
---|---  
map |  A finite ordered sequence of key/value pairs, with no key appearing
twice as specified in [[INFRA]]. A map is sometimes referred to as an ordered
map in [[INFRA]].  
list |  A finite ordered sequence of items as specified in [[INFRA]].  
ordered set |  A finite ordered sequence of items that does not contain the
same item twice as specified in [[INFRA]].  
datetime |  A date and time value that is capable of losslessly expressing all
values expressible by a `dateTime` as specified in [XMLSCHEMA11-2].  
string |  A sequence of code units often used to represent human readable
language as specified in [[INFRA]].  
integer |  A real number without a fractional component as specified in
[XMLSCHEMA11-2]. To maximize interoperability, implementers are urged to heed
the advice regarding integers in RFC8259, Section 6: Numbers.  
double |  A value that is often used to approximate arbitrary real numbers as
specified in [XMLSCHEMA11-2]. To maximize interoperability, implementers are
urged to heed the advice regarding doubles in RFC8259, Section 6: Numbers.  
boolean |  A value that is either true or false as defined in [[INFRA]].  
null |  A value that is used to indicate the lack of a value as defined in
[[INFRA]].  
  
As a result of the data model being defined using terminology from [[INFRA]],
property values which can contain more than one item, such as maps and sets,
are explicitly ordered. All list-like value structures in [[INFRA]] are
ordered, whether or not that order is significant. For the purposes of this
specification, unless otherwise stated, ordering is not important and
implementations are not expected to produce or consume deterministically
ordered values.

## Extensibility

The data model supports two types of extensibility.

  1. For maximum interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that extensions use the W3C DID Specification Registries mechanism [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. The use of this mechanism for new properties or other extensions is the only specified mechanism that ensures that two different representations will be able to work together. 
  2. Representations MAY define other extensibility mechanisms, including ones that do not require the use of the DID Specification Registries. Such extension mechanisms SHOULD support lossless conversion into any other conformant representation. Extension mechanisms for a representation SHOULD define a mapping of all properties and representation syntax into the data model and its type system. 

It is always possible for two specific implementations to agree out-of-band to
use a mutually understood extension or representation that is not recorded in
the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]; interoperability
between such implementations and the larger ecosystem will be less reliable.

# Core Properties

A DID is associated with a DID document. DID documents are expressed using the
data model and can be serialized into a representation. The following sections
define the properties in a DID document, including whether these properties
are required or optional. These properties describe relationships between the
DID subject and the value of the property.

The following tables contain informative references for the core properties
defined by this specification, with expected values, and whether or not they
are required. The property names in the tables are linked to the normative
definitions and more detailed descriptions of each property.

The property names `id`, `type`, and `controller` can be present in maps of
different types with possible differences in constraints.

## DID Document properties

---|---|---  
`id` | yes |  A string that conforms to the rules in .  
`alsoKnownAs` | no |  An ordered set of strings that conform to the rules of

for URIs, a map, or an ordered set composed of a one or more strings that
conform to the rules of [[RFC3986]] for URIs and/or maps.  
  
## Identifiers

This section describes the mechanisms by which DID documents include
identifiers for DID subjects and DID controllers.

### DID Subject

The DID for a particular DID subject is expressed using the `id` property in
the DID document.

id

     The value of `id` MUST be a string that conforms to the rules in  and MUST exist in the root map of the data model for the DID document. 
    
    
    {
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghijk"
    }
            

The `id` property only denotes the DID of the DID subject when it is present
in the _topmost_ map of the DID document.

DID method specifications can create intermediate representations of a DID
document that do not contain the `id` property, such as when a DID resolver is
performing DID resolution. However, the fully resolved DID document always
contains a valid `id` property.

### DID Controller

A DID controller is an entity that is authorized to make changes to a DID
document. The process of authorizing a DID controller is defined by the DID
method.

controller

     The `controller` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST be a string or an ordered set of strings that conform to the rules in . The corresponding DID document(s) SHOULD contain verification relationships that explicitly permit the use of certain verification methods for specific purposes. 

When a `controller` property is present in a DID document, its value expresses
one or more DIDs. Any verification methods contained in the DID documents for
those DIDs SHOULD be accepted as authoritative, such that proofs that satisfy
those verification methods are to be considered equivalent to proofs provided
by the DID subject.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "controller": "did:example:bcehfew7h32f32h7af3",
    }
            

Note that authorization provided by the value of `controller` is separate from
authentication as described in . This is particularly important for key
recovery in the case of cryptographic key loss, where the DID subject no
longer has access to their keys, or key compromise, where the DID controller's
trusted third parties need to override malicious activity by an attacker. See
for information related to threat models and attack vectors.

### Also Known As

The DID Working Group is seeking implementer feedback regarding the
alsoKnownAs feature. If there is not enough implementer interest in
implementing this feature, it will be removed from this specification and
placed into the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]] as an
extension.

A DID subject can have multiple identifiers for different purposes, or at
different times. The assertion that two or more DIDs (or other types of URI)
identify the same DID subject can be made using the `alsoKnownAs` property.

alsoKnownAs

     The `alsoKnownAs` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST be an ordered set where each item in the set is a URI conforming to [[RFC3986]]. 
     This relationship is a statement that the subject of this identifier is also identified by one or more other identifiers. 

Applications might choose to consider two identifiers related by `alsoKnownAs`
to be equivalent _if_ the `alsoKnownAs` relationship is reciprocated in the
reverse direction. It is best practice _not_ to consider them equivalent in
the absence of this inverse relationship. In other words, the presence of an
`alsoKnownAs` assertion does not prove that this assertion is true. Therefore,
it is strongly advised that a requesting party obtain independent verification
of an `alsoKnownAs` assertion.

Given that the DID subject might use different identifiers for different
purposes, an expectation of strong equivalence between the two identifiers, or
merging the information of the two corresponding DID documents, is not
necessarily appropriate, _even with_ a reciprocal relationship.

## Verification Methods

A DID document can express verification methods, such as cryptographic public
keys, which can be used to authenticate or authorize interactions with the DID
subject or associated parties. For example, a cryptographic public key can be
used as a verification method with respect to a digital signature; in such
usage, it verifies that the signer could use the associated cryptographic
private key. Verification methods might take many parameters. An example of
this is a set of five cryptographic keys from which any three are required to
contribute to a cryptographic threshold signature.

verificationMethod

    

The `verificationMethod` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST be
an ordered set of verification methods, where each verification method is
expressed using a map. The verification method map MUST include the `id`,
`type`, `controller`, and specific verification material properties that are
determined by the value of `type` and are defined in . A verification method
MAY include additional properties. Verification methods SHOULD be registered
in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

id

    

The value of the `id` property for a verification method MUST be a string that
conforms to the rules in Section .

type

     The value of the `type` property MUST be a string that references exactly one verification method type. In order to maximize global interoperability, the verification method type SHOULD be registered in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. 
controller

     The value of the `controller` property MUST be a string that conforms to the rules in . 
    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "verificationMethod": [{
        "id": ...,
        "type": ...,
        "controller": ...,
        "publicKeyJwk": ...
      }, {
        "id": ...,
        "type": ...,
        "controller": ...,
        "publicKeyBase58": ...
      }]
    }
          

The semantics of the `controller` property are the same when the subject of
the relationship is the DID document as when the subject of the relationship
is a verification method, such as a cryptographic public key. Since a key
can't control itself, and the key controller cannot be inferred from the DID
document, it is necessary to explicitly express the identity of the controller
of the key. The difference is that the value of `controller` for a
verification method is _not_ necessarily a DID controller. DID controllers are
expressed using the `controller` property at the highest level of the DID
document (the topmost map in the data model); see .

### Verification Material

Verification material is any information that is used by a process that
applies a verification method. The `type` of a verification method is expected
to be used to determine its compatibility with such processes. Examples of
verification material properties are `publicKeyJwk` or `publicKeyBase58`. A
verification suite definition is responsible for specifying the verification
method `type` and its associated verification material. For example, see [JSON
Web Signature 2020](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/) and [Ed25519
Signature 2018](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-ed25519-2018/). For all
registered verification method types and associated verification material
available for DIDs, please see the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-
REGISTRIES]].

To increase the likelihood of interoperable implementations, this
specification limits the number of formats for expressing verification
material in a DID document. The fewer formats that implementers have to
implement, the more likely it will be that they will support all of them. This
approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between ease of implementation
and supporting formats that have historically had broad deployment. Two
supported verification material properties are listed below:

publicKeyBase58

    

The `publicKeyBase58` property is OPTIONAL. This feature is non-normative. If
present, the value MUST be a string representation of a [[?BASE58]] encoded
public key.

The DID Working Group is seeking implementer feedback on the preference of the
ecosystem with respect to using `publicKeyBase58` [[?BASE58]] or
`publicKeyMultibase` [[?MULTIBASE]]. The latter can be used for encoding more
base-representation formats and provides a more future proof path. Depending
on implementer feedback, one or both options might be included in the final
specification, or migrated into the DID Specification Registries as an
extension.

publicKeyJwk

    

The `publicKeyJwk` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the value MUST be a map
representing a JSON Web Key that conforms to [[RFC7517]]. The map MUST NOT
contain "d", or any other members of the private information class as
described in [Registration
Template](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-8.1.1). It is
RECOMMENDED that verification methods that use JWKs [[RFC7517]] to represent
their public keys use the value of `kid` as their fragment identifier. It is
RECOMMENDED that JWK `kid` values are set to the public key fingerprint
[[RFC7638]]. See the first key in  for an example of a public key with a
compound key identifier.

A verification method MUST NOT contain multiple verification material
properties for the same material. For example, expressing key material in a
verification method using both `publicKeyJwk` and `publicKeyBase58` at the
same time is prohibited.

An example of a DID document containing verification methods using both
properties above is shown below.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "verificationMethod": [{
        "id": "did:example:123#_Qq0UL2Fq651Q0Fjd6TvnYE-faHiOpRlPVQcY_-tA4A",
        "type": "JsonWebKey2020", // external (property value)
        "controller": "did:example:123",
        "publicKeyJwk": {
          "crv": "Ed25519", // external (property name)
          "x": "VCpo2LMLhn6iWku8MKvSLg2ZAoC-nlOyPVQaO3FxVeQ", // external (property name)
          "kty": "OKP", // external (property name)
          "kid": "_Qq0UL2Fq651Q0Fjd6TvnYE-faHiOpRlPVQcY_-tA4A" // external (property name)
        }
      }, {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018", // external (property value)
        "controller": "did:example:pqrstuvwxyz0987654321",
        "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
      }],
      ...
    }
            

### Referring to Verification Methods

Verification methods can be embedded in or referenced from properties
associated with various verification relationships as described in .
Referencing verification methods allows them to be used by more than one
verification relationship.

If the value of a verification method property is a map, the verification
method has been embedded and its properties can be accessed directly. However,
if the value is a URL string, the verification method has been included by
reference and its properties will need to be retrieved from elsewhere in the
DID document or from another DID document. This is done by dereferencing the
URL and searching the resulting resource for a verification method map with an
`id` property whose value matches the URL.

    
    
    {
    ...
    
      "authentication": [
        // this key is referenced and might be used by
        // more than one verification relationship
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        // this key is embedded and may *only* be used for authentication
        {
          "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
          "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018", // external (property value)
          "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
          "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        }
      ],
    
    ...
    }
            

## Verification Relationships

A verification relationship expresses the relationship between the DID subject
and a verification method.

Different verification relationships enable the associated verification
methods to be used for different purposes. It is up to a _verifier_ to
ascertain the validity of a verification attempt by checking that the
verification method used is contained in the appropriate verification
relationship property of the DID Document.

The verification relationship between the DID subject and the verification
method is explicit in the DID document. Verification methods that are not
associated with a particular verification relationship cannot be used for that
verification relationship. For example, a verification method in the value of
the `authentication` property cannot be used to engage in key agreement
protocols with the DID subject--the value of the `keyAgreement` property needs
to be used for that.

The DID document does not express revoked keys using a verification
relationship. If a referenced verification method is not in the latest DID
Document used to dereference it, then that verification method is considered
invalid or revoked. Each DID method specification is expected to detail how
revocation is performed and tracked.

The following sections define several useful verification relationships. A DID
document MAY include any of these, or other properties, to express a specific
verification relationship. In order to maximize global interoperability, any
such properties used SHOULD be registered in the DID Specification Registries
[[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

## Authentication

The `authentication` verification relationship is used to specify how the DID
subject is expected to be authenticated, for purposes such as logging into a
website or engaging in any sort of challenge-response protocol.

authentication

     The `authentication` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated value MUST be an ordered set of one or more verification methods. Each verification method MAY be embedded or referenced. 
    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "authentication": [
        // this method can be used to authenticate as did:...fghi
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        // this method is *only* approved for authentication, it may not
        // be used for any other proof purpose, so its full description is
        // embedded here rather than using only a reference
        {
          "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
          "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
          "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
          "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        }
      ],
      ...
    }
            

If authentication is established, it is up to the DID method or other
application to decide what to do with that information. A particular DID
method could decide that authenticating as a DID controller is sufficient to,
for example, update or delete the DID document. Another DID method could
require different keys, or a different verification method entirely, to be
presented in order to update or delete the DID document than that used to
authenticate. In other words, what is done _after_ the authentication check is
out of scope for the data model; DID methods and applications are expected to
define this themselves.

This is useful to any _authentication verifier_ that needs to check to see if
an entity that is attempting to authenticate is, in fact, presenting a valid
proof of authentication. When a _verifier_ receives some data (in some
protocol-specific format) that contains a proof that was made for the purpose
of "authentication", and that says that an entity is identified by the DID,
then that _verifier_ checks to ensure that the proof can be verified using a
verification method (e.g., public key) listed under `authentication` in the
DID Document.

Note that the verification method indicated by the `authentication` property
of a DID document can only be used to authenticate the DID subject. To
authenticate a different DID controller, the entity associated with the value
of `controller`, as defined in , needs to authenticate with its _own_ DID
document and associated `authentication` verification relationship.

## Assertion

The `assertionMethod` verification relationship is used to specify how the DID
subject is expected to express claims, such as for the purposes of issuing a
Verifiable Credential [[?VC-DATA-MODEL]].

assertionMethod

     The `assertionMethod` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated value MUST be an ordered set of one or more verification methods. Each verification method MAY be embedded or referenced. 

This property is useful, for example, during the processing of a verifiable
credential by a verifier. During verification, a verifier checks to see if a
verifiable credential contains a proof created by the DID subject by checking
that the verification method used to assert the proof is associated with the
`assertionMethod` property in the corresponding DID document.

    
    
    {
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    ...
    "assertionMethod": [
      // this method can be used to assert statements as did:...fghi
      "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
      // this method is *only* approved for assertion of statements, it is not
      // used for any other verification relationship, so its full description is
      // embedded here rather than using a reference
      {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018", // external (property value)
        "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
      }
    ],
    ...
    }
            

## Key Agreement

The `keyAgreement` verification relationship is used to specify how an entity
can generate encryption material in order to transmit confidential information
intended for the DID subject, such as for the purposes of establishing a
secure communication channel with the recipient.

keyAgreement

     The `keyAgreement` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated value MUST be an ordered set of one or more verification methods. Each verification method MAY be embedded or referenced. 

An example of when this property is useful is when encrypting a message
intended for the DID subject. In this case, the counterparty uses the
cryptographic public key information in the verification method to wrap a
decryption key for the recipient.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "keyAgreement": [
        // this method can be used to perform key agreement as did:...fghi
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        // this method is *only* approved for key agreement usage, it will not
        // be used for any other verification relationship, so its full description is
        // embedded here rather than using only a reference
        {
          "id": "did:example:123#zC9ByQ8aJs8vrNXyDhPHHNNMSHPcaSgNpjjsBYpMMjsTdS",
          "type": "X25519KeyAgreementKey2019", // external (property value)
          "controller": "did:example:123",
          "publicKeyBase58": "9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
        }
      ],
      ...
    }
            

## Capability Invocation

The `capabilityInvocation` verification relationship is used to specify a
verification method that might be used by the DID subject to invoke a
cryptographic capability, such as the authorization to update the DID
Document.

capabilityInvocation

     The `capabilityInvocation` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated value MUST be an ordered set of one or more verification methods. Each verification method MAY be embedded or referenced. 

An example of when this property is useful is when a DID subject needs to
access a protected HTTP API that requires authorization in order to use it. In
order to authorize when using the HTTP API, the DID subject uses a capability
that is associated with a particular URL that is exposed via the HTTP API. The
invocation of the capability could be expressed in a number of ways, e.g., as
a digitally signed message that is placed into the HTTP Headers.

The server providing the HTTP API is the _verifier_ of the capability and it
would need to verify that the verification method referred to by the invoked
capability exists in the `capabilityInvocation` property of the DID document.
The verifier would also check to make sure that the action being performed is
valid and the capability is appropriate for the resource being accessed. If
the verification is successful, the server has cryptographically determined
that the invoker is authorized to access the protected resource.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1", "id":
      "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "capabilityInvocation": [
        // this method can be used to invoke capabilities as did:...fghi
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        // this method is *only* approved for capability invocation usage, it will not
        // be used for any other verification relationship, so its full description is
        // embedded here rather than using only a reference
        {
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018", // external (property value)
        "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
        "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        }
      ],
      ...
    }
            

## Capability Delegation

The `capabilityDelegation` verification relationship is used to specify a
mechanism that might be used by the DID subject to delegate a cryptographic
capability to another party, such as delegating the authority to access a
specific HTTP API to a subordinate.

capabilityDelegation

     The `capabilityDelegation` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated value MUST be an ordered set of one or more verification methods. Each verification method MAY be embedded or referenced. 

An example of when this property is useful is when a DID controller chooses to
delegate their capability to access a protected HTTP API to a party other than
themselves. In order to delegate the capability, the DID subject would use a
verification method associated with the `capabilityDelegation` verification
relationship to cryptographically sign the capability over to another DID
subject. The delegate would then use the capability in a manner that is
similar to the example described in .

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1", "id":
      "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      ...
      "capabilityDelegation": [
        // this method can be used to perform capability delegation as did:...fghi
        "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
        // this method is *only* approved for granting capabilities; it will not

## Services

Services are used in DID documents to express ways of communicating with the
DID subject or associated entities. A service can be any type of service the
DID subject wants to advertise, including decentralized identity management
services for further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction.

Due to privacy concerns, revealing public information through services, such
as social media accounts, personal websites, and email addresses, is
discouraged. Further exploration of privacy concerns can be found in  and .
The information associated with services is often service specific. For
example, the information associated with an encrypted messaging service can
express how to initiate the encrypted link before messaging begins.

Services are expressed using the `service` property, which is described below:

service

    

The `service` property is OPTIONAL. If present, the associated value MUST be
an ordered set of services, where each service is described by a map. Each
service map MUST contain `id`, `type`, and `serviceEndpoint` properties. Each
service extension MAY include additional properties and MAY further restrict
the properties associated with the extension.

id

     The value of the `id` property MUST be a URI conforming to [[RFC3986]]. A conforming producer MUST NOT produce multiple `service` entries with the same `id`. A conforming consumer MUST produce an error if it detects multiple `service` entries with the same `id`. 
type

     The value of the `type` property MUST be a string or an ordered set of strings. In order to maximize interoperability, the verification method type and its associated properties SHOULD be registered in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. 
serviceEndpoint

     The value of the `serviceEndpoint` property MUST be a string, a map, or an ordered set composed of one or more strings and/or maps. All string values MUST be valid URIs conforming to [[RFC3986]] and normalized according to the Normalization and Comparison rules in RFC3986 and to any normalization rules in its applicable URI scheme specification. 

For more information regarding privacy and security considerations related to
services see , , , and .

# Representations

A concrete serialization of a DID document in this specification is called a
representation. A representation is created by serializing the data model
through a process called production. A representation is transformed into the
data model through a process called consumption. The _production_ and
_consumption_ processes enable the conversion of information from one
representation to another. This specification defines representations for
JSON, JSON-LD, and CBOR, and developers can use any other representation, such
as XML or YAML, that is capable of expressing the data model. The following
sections define the general rules for production and consumption, as well as
the JSON, JSON-LD, and CBOR representations.

## Production and Consumption

In addition to the representations defined in this specification, implementers
can use other representations, providing each such representation is properly
specified (including rules for interoperable handling of properties not listed
in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]). See  for more
information.

The requirements for all representations are as follows:

  1. A representation MUST define deterministic production and consumption rules for all data types specified in . 
  2. A representation MUST be uniquely associated with an IANA-registered Media Type. 
  3. A representation MUST define fragment processing rules for its Media Type that are conformant with the fragment processing rules defined in . 
  4. A representation SHOULD use the lexical representation of data model data types. For example, JSON and JSON-LD use the XML Schema `dateTime` lexical serialization to represent datetimes. A representation MAY choose to serialize the data model data types using a different lexical serializations as long as the consumption process back into the data model is lossless. For example, some CBOR-based representations express datetime values using integers to represent the number of seconds since the Unix epoch. 
  5. A representation MAY define representation-specific entries that are stored in a representation-specific entries map for use during the production and consumption process. These entries are used when consuming or producing to aid in ensuring lossless conversion. 
  6. In order to maximize interoperability, representation specification authors SHOULD register their representation in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. 

The requirements for all conforming producers are as follows:

  1. A conforming producer MUST take a DID document data model and a representation-specific entries map as input into the production process. The conforming producer MAY accept additional options as input into the production process. 
  2. A conforming producer MUST serialize all entries in the DID document data model, and the representation-specific entries map, that do not have explicit processing rules for the representation being produced using only the representation's data type processing rules and return the serialization after the production process completes. 
  3. A conforming producer MUST return the Media Type string associated with the representation after the production process completes. 

The requirements for all conforming consumers are as follows:

  1. A conforming consumer MUST take a representation and Media Type string as input into the consumption process. A conforming consumer MAY accept additional options as input into the consumption process. 
  2. A conforming consumer MUST determine the representation of a DID document using the Media Type input string. 
  3. A conforming consumer MUST detect any representation-specific entry across all known representations and place the entry into a representation-specific entries map which is returned after the consumption process completes. A list of all known representation-specific entries is available in the DID Specification Registries [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. 
  4. A conforming consumer MUST add all non-representation-specific entries that do not have explicit processing rules for the representation being consumed to the DID document data model using only the representation's data type processing rules and return the DID document data model after the consumption process completes. 

An implementation is expected to convert between representations by using the
_consumption_ rules on the source representation resulting in the data model
and then using the _production_ rules to serialize data model to the target
representation, or any other mechanism that results in the same target
representation.

## JSON

This section defines the production and consumption rules for the JSON
representation.

### Production

The DID document, DID document data structures, and representation-specific
entries map MUST be serialized to the JSON representation according to the
following production rules:

Data Type  |  JSON Representation Type  
---|---  
map |  A JSON Object, where each entry is serialized as a member of the JSON
Object with the entry key as a JSON String member name and the entry value
according to its type, as defined in this table.  
list |  A JSON Array, where each element of the list is serialized, in order,
as a value of the array according to its type, as defined in this table.  
ordered set |  A JSON Array, where each element of the set is added, in order,
as a value of the array according to its type, as defined in this table.  
datetime |  A JSON String serialized as an XML Datetime normalized to UTC
00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision. For example:
`2020-12-20T19:17:47Z`.  
string |  A JSON String.  
integer |  A JSON Number without a decimal or fractional component.  
double |  A JSON Number with a decimal and fractional component.  
boolean |  A JSON Boolean.  
null |  A JSON null literal.  
  
All implementers creating conforming producers that produce JSON
representations are advised to ensure that their algorithms are aligned with
the JSON serialization rules in the [[INFRA]] specification and the precision
advisements regarding Numbers in the JSON [[RFC7159]] specification.

All entries of a DID document MUST be included in the root JSON Object.
Entries MAY contain additional data substructures subject to the value
representation rules in the list above. When serializing a DID document, a
conforming producer MUST specify a media type of `application/did+json` to
downstream applications such as described in .

    
    
    {
    	"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    	"authentication": [{
    		"id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
    		"type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
    		"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    		"publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
    	}]
    }
          

### Consumption

The DID document and DID document data structures JSON representation MUST be
deserialized into the data model according to the following consumption rules:

JSON Representation Type  |  Data Type  
---|---  
JSON Object |  An map, where each member of the JSON Object is added as an
entry to the map. Each entry key is set as the JSON Object member name. Each
entry value is set by converting the JSON Object member value according to the
JSON representation type as defined in this table. Since order is not
specified by JSON Objects, no insertion order is guaranteed.  
JSON Array where the data model entry value is a list or unknown  |  A list,
where each value of the JSON Array is added to the list in order, converted
based on the JSON representation type of the array value, as defined in this
table.  
JSON Array where the data model entry value is an ordered set |  An ordered
set, where each value of the JSON Array is added to the ordered set in order,
converted based on the JSON representation type of the array value, as defined
in this table.  
JSON String where data model entry value is a datetime |  A datetime.  
JSON String, where the data model entry value type is string or unknown  |  A
string.  
JSON Number without a decimal or fractional component  |  An integer.  
JSON Number with a decimal and fractional component, or when entry value is a
double regardless of inclusion of fractional component  |  A double.  
JSON Boolean |  A boolean.  
JSON null literal |  A null value.  
  
All implementers creating conforming consumers that produce JSON
representations are advised to ensure that their algorithms are aligned with
the JSON conversion rules in the [[INFRA]] specification and the precision
advisements regarding Numbers in the JSON [[RFC8259]] specification.

If media type information is available to a conforming consumer and the media
type value is `application/did+json`, then the data structure being consumed
is a DID document, and the root element MUST be a JSON Object where all
members of the object are entries of the DID document. A conforming consumer
for a JSON representation that is consuming a DID document with a root element
that is not a JSON Object MUST report an error.

## JSON-LD

JSON-LD [[JSON-LD11]] is a JSON-based format used to serialize [Linked
Data](http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data). This section defines the
production and consumption rules for the JSON-LD representation.

The JSON-LD representation defines the following representation-specific
entries:

@context

     The [JSON-LD Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#the-context) is either a string or a list containing any combination of strings and/or ordered maps. 

### Production

The DID document, DID document data structures, and representation-specific
entries map MUST be MUST be serialized to the JSON-LD representation according
to the JSON representation production rules as defined in .

In addition to using the JSON representation production rules, JSON-LD
production MUST include the representation-specific `@context` entry. The
serialized value of `@context` MUST be the JSON String
`https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1`, or a JSON Array where the first item is the
JSON String `https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1` and the subsequent items are
serialized according to the JSON representation production rules.

    
    
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      ...
    }
            
    
    
    {
      "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://did-method-extension.example/v1"
      ],
      ...
    }
            

All implementers creating conforming producers that produce JSON-LD
representations are advised to ensure that their algorithms produce valid
JSON-LD [[JSON-LD11]] documents. Invalid JSON-LD documents will cause JSON-LD
processors to halt and report errors.

In order to achieve interoperability across different representations, all
JSON-LD Contexts and their terms SHOULD be registered in the DID Specification
Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

A conforming producer that generates a JSON-LD representation SHOULD NOT
produce a DID document that contains terms not defined via the `@context` as
conforming consumers are expected to remove unknown terms. When serializing a
JSON-LD representation of a DID document, a conforming producer MUST specify a
media type of `application/did+ld+json` to downstream applications such as
described in .

Use of the media type `application/did+ld+json` is pending clarification over
the registration of [ media types with multiple
suffixes](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-w3cdidwg-media-types-
with-multiple-suffixes). The alternative will be to use `application/ld+json`
with an expected profile parameter of `https://www.w3.org/ns/did/json-ld-
profile` if multiple suffixes cannot be registered by the time the rest of DID
Core is ready for W3C Proposed Recommendation. See also [ Issue
208](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/208).

### Consumption

The DID document and any DID document data structures expressed by a JSON-LD
representation MUST be deserialized into the data model according to the JSON
representation consumption rules as defined in .

All implementers creating conforming consumers that consume JSON-LD
representations are advised to ensure that their algorithms only accept valid
JSON-LD [[JSON-LD11]] documents. Invalid JSON-LD documents will cause JSON-LD
processors to halt and report errors.

Conforming consumers that process a JSON-LD representation SHOULD drop all
terms from a DID document that are not defined via the `@context`.

## CBOR

This section defines the production and consumption rules for the CBOR
representation.

The Working Group is seeking volunteers to write tests for, and at least two
independent and interoperable implementations of, the CBOR representation
during the Candidate Recommendation phase. If these goals are not met, this
section will be removed from this specification.

### Production

The DID document, DID document data structures, and representation-specific
entries map MUST be serialized to the CBOR representation according to the
following production rules:

Data Type  |  CBOR Representation Type  
---|---  
map |  A CBOR map (major type 5), where each entry is represented as a member
of the CBOR map. The entry key is expressed as a CBOR string (major type 3) as
the key, and the entry value according to its type, as defined in this table.  
list |  A CBOR array (major type 4), where each element of the list is added,
in order, as a value of the array according to its type, as defined in this
table.  
ordered set |  A CBOR array (major type 4), where each element of the list is
added, in order, as a value of the array according to its type, as defined in
this table.  
datetime |  A CBOR string (major type 3) formatted as an XML Datetime
normalized to UTC 00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision. For example:
`2020-12-20T19:17:47Z`.  
string |  A CBOR string (major type 3).  
integer |  A CBOR integer (major type 0 or 1), choosing the shortest byte
representation.  
double |  A CBOR floating-point number (major type 7). All floating point
values MUST be encoded as 64-bits (additional type value 27), even for
integral values.  
boolean |  A CBOR simple value (major type 7, subtype 24) with a simple value
of 21 (true) or 20 (false).  
null |  A CBOR simple value (major type 7, subtype 24) with a simple value of
22 (null).  
  
In addition to the data type production rules above, the following rules apply
for conforming producers that serialize CBOR representations:

  1. Indefinite-length items are not allowed and MUST be made a CBOR definite length.
  2. All CBOR tags MUST be retained regardless of whether they are optional. 
  3. All four Canonical CBOR rules listed in [[RFC8949]] MUST be applied to all relevant data types. 

All entries of a DID document MUST be included in the root CBOR map (major
type 5). Entries MAY contain additional data substructures subject to the
value representation rules in the list above. When serializing a DID document
to its CBOR representation, a conforming producer MUST specify a media type of
`application/did+cbor` to downstream applications such as described in .

The following examples express the CBOR representation of a DID document in
hexidecimal notation, and in CBOR diagnostic notation:

### Consumption

The DID document and any DID document data structures expressed by the data
model MUST be deserialized into the data model according to the following
consumption rules:

CBOR Representation Type  |  Data Type  
---|---  
CBOR map (major type 5)  |  An map, where each data item of the CBOR map is
added as an entry to the map with the entry key being the data item name and
the value converted based on the CBOR type and, if available, entry
definition, as defined here; as no order can be enforced for general CBOR
maps, no insertion order is guaranteed.  
CBOR array (major type 4), where the data model entry value is a list or
unknown  |  A list, where each value of the CBOR array is added to the list in
order, converted based on the CBOR type of the array value, as defined in this
table.  
CBOR array (major type 4), where the data model entry value is an ordered set
|  An ordered set, where each value of the CBOR array is added to the ordered
set in order, converted based on the CBOR type of the array value as defined
in this table.  
CBOR string (major type 3) where the data model entry value is a datetime |  A
datetime.  
CBOR string (major type 3), where the data model entry value type is string or
unknown  |  A string.  
CBOR integer (major type 0 or 1), choosing the shortest byte representation  |
An integer.  
CBOR floating-point number (major type 7)  |  A double.  
CBOR simple value (major type 7, subtype 24) with a simple value of 21 (True)
or 20 (False)  |  A boolean.  
CBOR simple value (major type 7, subtype 24) with a simple value of 22 (Null)
|  A null value.  
  
In addition to the data type consumption rules above, the following rules
apply for conforming consumers that deserialize CBOR representations:

  1. CBOR indefinite-length items are not allowed and MUST produce an error. 
  2. A duplicate key in the same CBOR map MUST produce an error. 
  3. All CBOR tags MUST be retained for CBOR production regardless of whether they are optional. 

If media type information is available to a conforming consumer and the media
type value is `application/did+cbor`, then the data structure being consumed
is a DID document, and the root element MUST be a CBOR map (major type 5)
where all members of the object are entries of the DID document. A conforming
consumer for a CBOR representation that is consuming a DID document with a
root element that is not a CBOR map (major type 5) MUST report an error.

# Resolution

The Working Group is unsure if there will be enough implementation experience
for the DID Resolution section. We are seeking feedback from the
implementation community as to whether they prefer to do all of this work now,
or if they would prefer that this section is, or parts of the section are,
rewritten to be non-normative, or published as a NOTE and taken up in a future
W3C DID Resolution Working Group. If there is support for rewriting a subset
of the DID Resolution section, or publishing any part of it as a NOTE during
the W3C Candidate Recommendation process, this section will be modified and/or
published as a NOTE appropriately before the DID Core specification proceeds
to the W3C Proposed Recommendation stage. See also [ Issue
549](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/549).

This section defines the inputs and outputs of DID resolution and DID URL
dereferencing. Their exact implementation is out of scope for this
specification, but some considerations for implementors are discussed in
[[?DID-RESOLUTION]].

All conformant DID resolvers MUST implement the DID resolution functions for
at least one DID method and MUST be able to return a DID document in at least
one conformant representation.

## DID Resolution

The DID resolution functions resolve a DID into a DID document by using the
"Read" operation of the applicable DID method as described in . The details of
how this process is accomplished are outside the scope of this specification,
but all conforming DID resolvers implement the functions below, which have the
following abstract forms:

    
    
    resolve(did, resolutionOptions) →
       « didResolutionMetadata, didDocument, didDocumentMetadata »
    
    resolveRepresentation(did, resolutionOptions) →
       « didResolutionMetadata, didDocumentStream, didDocumentMetadata »
            

The `resolve` function returns the DID document in its abstract form (a map).
The `resolveRepresentation` function returns a byte stream of the DID Document
formatted in the corresponding representation. The input variables of the
`resolve` and `resolveRepresentation` functions are as follows:

did

     This is the DID to resolve. This input is REQUIRED and the value MUST be a conformant DID as defined in . 
resolutionOptions

     A metadata structure containing properties defined in . This input is REQUIRED, but the structure MAY be empty. 

These functions each return multiple values, and no limitations are placed on
how these values are returned together. The return values of `resolve` are
didResolutionMetadata, didDocument, and didDocumentMetadata. The return values
of `resolveRepresentation` are didResolutionMetadata, didDocumentStream, and
didDocumentMetadata. These values are described below:

didResolutionMetadata

     A metadata structure consisting of values relating to the results of the DID resolution process which typically changes between invocations of the `resolve` and `resolveRepresentation` functions, as it represents data about the resolution process itself. This structure is REQUIRED, and MUST NOT be empty. This metadata is defined by . If `resolveRepresentation` was called, this structure MUST contain a `contentType` property containing the Media Type of the representation found in the `didDocumentStream`. If the resolution is not successful, this structure MUST contain an `error` property describing the error. 
didDocument

     If the resolution is successful, and if the `resolve` function was called, this MUST be a DID document abstract data model (a map) as described in  that is capable of being transformed into a conforming DID Document (representation), using the production rules specified by the representation. The value of `id` in the resolved DID document MUST match the DID that was resolved. If the resolution is unsuccessful, this value MUST be empty. 
didDocumentStream

     If the resolution is successful, and if the `resolveRepresentation` function was called, this MUST be a byte stream of the resolved DID document in one of the conformant representations. The byte stream might then be parsed by the caller of the `resolveRepresentation` function into a data model, which can in turn be validated and processed. If the resolution is unsuccessful, this value MUST be an empty stream. 
didDocumentMetadata

     If the resolution is successful, this MUST be a metadata structure. This structure contains metadata about the DID document contained in the `didDocument` property. This metadata typically does not change between invocations of the `resolve` and `resolveRepresentation` functions unless the DID document changes, as it represents metadata about the DID document. If the resolution is unsuccessful, this output MUST be an empty metadata structure. Properties defined by this specification are in . 

Conforming DID resolver implementations do not alter the signature of these
functions in any way. DID resolver implementations might map the `resolve` and
`resolveRepresentation` functions to a method-specific internal function to
perform the actual DID resolution process. DID resolver implementations might
implement and expose additional functions with different signatures in
addition to the `resolve` and `resolveRepresentation` functions specified
here.

### DID Resolution Options

The possible properties within this structure and their possible values are
registered in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. This
specification defines the following common properties.

accept

     The Media Type of the caller's preferred representation of the DID document. The Media Type MUST be expressed as an ASCII string. The DID resolver implementation SHOULD use this value to determine the representation contained in the returned `didDocumentStream` if such a representation is supported and available. This property is OPTIONAL for the `resolveRepresentation` function and MUST NOT be used with the `resolve` function. 

### DID Resolution Metadata

The possible properties within this structure and their possible values are
registered in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. This
specification defines the following DID resolution metadata properties:

contentType

     The Media Type of the returned `didDocumentStream`. This property is REQUIRED if resolution is successful and if the `resolveRepresentation` function was called. This property MUST NOT be present if the `resolve` function was called. The value of this property MUST be an ASCII string that is the Media Type of the conformant representations. The caller of the `resolveRepresentation` function MUST use this value when determining how to parse and process the `didDocumentStream` returned by this function into the data model. 
error

     The error code from the resolution process. This property is REQUIRED when there is an error in the resolution process. The value of this property MUST be a single keyword ASCII string. The possible property values of this field SHOULD be registered in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. This specification defines the following common error values: 

invalidDid

     The DID supplied to the DID resolution function does not conform to valid syntax. (See .) 
notFound

     The DID resolver was unable to find the DID document resulting from this resolution request. 
representationNotSupported

     This error code is returned if the representation requested via the `accept` input metadata property is not supported by the DID method and/or DID resolver implementation. 
deactivated

     The DID supplied to the DID resolution function has been deactivated as described in . 

### DID Document Metadata

The possible properties within this structure and their possible values SHOULD
be registered in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
This specification defines the following common properties.

created

     DID document metadata SHOULD include a `created` property to indicate the timestamp of the Create operation. The value of the property MUST be a string formatted as an XML Datetime normalized to UTC 00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision. For example: `2020-12-20T19:17:47Z`. 
updated

     DID document metadata SHOULD include an `updated` property to indicate the timestamp of the last Update operation for the document version which was resolved. The value of the property MUST follow the same formatting rules as the `created` property. The `updated` property is omitted if an Update operation has never been performed on the DID document. If an `updated` property exists, it can be the same value as the `created` property when the difference between the two timestamps is less than one second. 
nextUpdate

    

The DID Working Group is seeking implementer feedback on this feature. If
there is not enough implementation experience with this feature at the end of
the Candidate Recommendation period, it will be removed from the
specification.

DID document metadata MAY include a `nextUpdate` property if the resolved
document version is not the latest version of the document. It indicates the
timestamp of the next Update operation. The value of the property MUST follow
the same formatting rules as the `created` property.

versionId

     DID document metadata SHOULD include a `versionId` property to indicate the version of the last Update operation for the document version which was resolved. The value of the property MUST be an ASCII string. 
nextVersionId

    

The DID Working Group is seeking implementer feedback on this feature. If
there is not enough implementation experience with this feature at the end of
the Candidate Recommendation period, it will be removed from the
specification.

DID document metadata MAY include a `nextVersionId` property if the resolved
document version is not the latest version of the document. It indicates the
version of the next Update operation. The value of the property MUST be an
ASCII string.

equivalentId

    

The DID Working Group is seeking implementer feedback on this feature. If
there is not enough implementation experience with this feature at the end of
the Candidate Recommendation period, it will be removed from the
specification.

A DID Method can define different forms of a DID that are logically
equivalent. An example is when a DID takes one form prior to registration in a
verifiable data registry and another form after such registration. In this
case, the DID Method specification might need to express one or more DIDs that
are logically equivalent to the resolved DID as a property of the DID
document. This is the purpose of the `equivalentId` property.

The value of `equivalentId` MUST be an ordered set where each item in the list
is a string that conforms to the rules in Section . The relationship is a
statement that each `equivalentId` value is logically equivalent to the `id`
property value and thus identifies the same DID subject. Each `equivalentId`
DID value MUST be produced by, and a form of, the same DID Method as the `id`
property value. (e.g., `did:example:abc` == `did:example:ABC`)

     A conforming DID Method specification MUST guarantee that each `equivalentId` value is logically equivalent to the `id` property value. 

A requesting party is expected to retain the values from the `id` and
`equivalentId` properties to ensure any subsequent interactions with any of
the values they contain are correctly handled as logically equivalent (e.g.
retain all variants in a database so an interaction with any one maps to the
same underlying account).

`equivalentId` is a much stronger form of equivalence than `alsoKnownAs`
because the equivalence MUST be guaranteed by the governing DID method.
`equivalentId` represents a full graph merge because the same DID document
describes both the `equivalentId` DID and the `id` property DID.

If a requesting party does not retain the values from the `id` and
`equivalentId` properties and ensure any subsequent interactions with any of
the values they contain are correctly handled as logically equivalent, there
might be negative or unexpected issues that arise. Implementers are strongly
advised to observe the directives related to this metadata property.

canonicalId

    

The DID Working Group is seeking implementer feedback on this feature. If
there is not enough implementation experience with this feature at the end of
the Candidate Recommendation period, it will be removed from the
specification.

The `canonicalId` property is identical to the `equivalentId` property except:
a) it is associated with a single value rather than a ordered set, and b) the
DID is defined to be the canonical ID for the DID subject within the scope of
the containing DID document.

The value of `canonicalId` MUST be a string that conforms to the rules in
Section . The relationship is a statement that the `canonicalId` value is
logically equivalent to the `id` property value and that the `canonicalId`
value is defined by the DID Method to be the canonical ID for the DID subject
in the scope of the containing DID document. A `canonicalId` value MUST be
produced by, and a form of, the same DID Method as the `id` property value.
(e.g., `did:example:abc` == `did:example:ABC`). A conforming DID Method
specification MUST guarantee that the `canonicalId` value is logically
equivalent to the `id` property value.

A requesting party is expected to use the `canonicalId` value as its primary
ID value for the DID subject and treat all other equivalent values as
secondary aliases (e.g. update corresponding primary references in their
systems to reflect the new canonical ID directive).

`canonicalId` is the same statement of equivalence as `equivalentId` except it
is constrained to a single value that is defined to be canonical for the DID
subject in the scope of the DID document. Like `equivalentId`, `canonicalId`
represents a full graph merge because the same DID document describes both the
`canonicalId` DID and the `id` property DID.

If a resolving party does not use the `canonicalId` value as its primary ID
value for the DID subject and treat all other equivalent values as secondary
aliases, there might be negative or unexpected issues that arise related to
user experience. Implementers are strongly advised to observe the directives
related to this metadata property.

## DID URL Dereferencing

The DID URL dereferencing function dereferences a DID URL into a resource with
contents depending on the DID URL's components, including the DID method,
method-specific identifier, path, query, and fragment. This process depends on
DID resolution of the DID contained in the DID URL. DID URL dereferencing
might involve multiple steps (e.g., when the DID URL being dereferenced
includes a fragment), and the function is defined to return the final resource
after all steps are completed. The details of how this process is accomplished
are outside the scope of this specification, but all conforming DID resolvers
implement the following function which has the following abstract form:

    
    
    dereference(didUrl, dereferenceOptions) →
       « dereferencingMetadata, contentStream, contentMetadata »
          

The input variables of the `dereference` function are as follows:

didUrl

     A conformant DID URL as a single string. This is the DID URL to dereference. To dereference a DID fragment, the complete DID URL including the DID fragment MUST be used. This input is REQUIRED. 
dereferencingOptions

     A [metadata structure](metadata-structure) consisting of input options to the `dereference` function in addition to the `didUrl` itself. Properties defined by this specification are in . This input is REQUIRED, but the structure MAY be empty. 

This function returns multiple values, and no limitations are placed on how
these values are returned together. The return values of the `dereference`
include `dereferencingMetadata`, `contentStream`, and `contentMetadata`:

dereferencingMetadata

     A [metadata structure](metadata-structure) consisting of values relating to the results of the DID URL dereferencing process. This structure is REQUIRED and in the case of an error in the dereferencing process, this MUST NOT be empty. Properties defined by this specification are in . If the dereferencing is not successful, this structure MUST contain an `error` property describing the error. 
contentStream

     If the `dereferencing` function was called and successful, this MUST contain a resource corresponding to the DID URL. The `contentStream` MAY be a resource such as a [DID Document]() that is serializable in one of the conformant representations, a Verification Method, a service, or any other resource format that can be identified via a Media Type and obtained through the resolution process. If the dereferencing is unsuccessful, this value MUST be empty. 
contentMetadata

     If the dereferencing is successful, this MUST be a [ metadata structure](metadata-structure), but the structure MAY be empty. This structure contains metadata about the `contentStream`. If the `contentStream` is a DID document, this MUST be a didDocumentMetadata structure as described in DID Resolution. If the dereferencing is unsuccessful, this output MUST be an empty [metadata structure](metadata-structure). 

Conforming DID URL dereferencing implementations do not alter the signature of
these functions in any way. DID URL dereferencing implementations might map
the `dereference` function to a method-specific internal function to perform
the actual DID URL dereferencing process. DID URL dereferencing
implementations might implement and expose additional functions with different
signatures in addition to the `dereference` function specified here.

### DID URL Dereferencing Options

The possible properties within this structure and their possible values SHOULD
be registered in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
This specification defines the following common properties for dereferencing
options:

accept

     The Media Type that the caller prefers for `contentStream`. The Media Type MUST be expressed as an ASCII string. The DID URL dereferencing implementation SHOULD use this value to determine the `contentType` of the representation contained in the returned value if such a representation is supported and available. 

### DID URL Dereferencing Metadata

The possible properties within this structure and their possible values are
registered in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. This
specification defines the following common properties.

contentType

     The Media Type of the returned `contentStream` SHOULD be expressed using this property if dereferencing is successful. The Media Type value MUST be expressed as an ASCII string. 
error

     The error code from the dereferencing process. This property is REQUIRED when there is an error in the dereferencing process. The value of this property MUST be a single keyword expressed as an ASCII string. The possible property values of this field SHOULD be registered in the DID Specification Registries [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. This specification defines the following common error values: 

invalidDidUrl

     The DID URL supplied to the DID URL dereferencing function does not conform to valid syntax. (See .) 
notFound

     The DID URL dereferencer was unable to find the `contentStream` resulting from this dereferencing request. 

## Metadata Structure

Input and output metadata is often involved during the DID Resolution, DID URL
dereferencing, and other DID-related processes. The structure used to
communicate this metadata MUST be a map of properties. Each property name MUST
be a string. Each property value MUST be a string, map, list, ordered set,
boolean, or null. The values within any complex data structures such as maps
and lists MUST be one of these data types as well. All metadata property
definitions registered in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-
REGISTRIES]] MUST define the value type, including any additional formats or
restrictions to that value (for example, a string formatted as a date or as a
decimal integer). It is RECOMMENDED that property definitions use strings for
values. The entire metadata structure MUST be serializable according to the
JSON serialization rules in the [[INFRA]] specification. Implementations MAY
serialize the metadata structure to other data formats.

All implementations of functions that use metadata structures as either input
or output are able to fully represent all data types described here in a
deterministic fashion. As inputs and outputs using metadata structures are
defined in terms of data types and not their serialization, the method for
representation is internal to the implementation of the function and is out of
scope of this specification.

The following example demonstrates a JSON-encoded metadata structure that
might be used as DID resolution input metadata.

    
    
    {
      "accept": "application/did+ld+json"
    }
            

This example corresponds to a metadata structure of the following format:

    
    
    «[
      "accept" → "application/did+ld+json"
    ]»
            

The next example demonstrates a JSON-encoded metadata structure that might be
used as DID resolution metadata if a DID was not found.

    
    
    {
      "error": "notFound"
    }
            

This example corresponds to a metadata structure of the following format:

    
    
    «[
      "error" → "notFound"
    ]»
            

The next example demonstrates a JSON-encoded metadata structure that might be
used as DID document metadata to describe timestamps associated with the DID
document.

    
    
    {
      "created": "2019-03-23T06:35:22Z",
      "updated": "2023-08-10T13:40:06Z"
    }
            

This example corresponds to a metadata structure of the following format:

    
    
    «[
      "created" → "2019-03-23T06:35:22Z",
      "updated" → "2023-08-10T13:40:06Z"
    ]»
            

# Methods

A DID method defines how implementers can realize the features described by
this specification. DID methods are often associated with a particular
verifiable data registry. New DID methods are defined in their own
specifications to enable interoperability between different implementations of
the same DID method.

Conceptually, the relationship between this specification and a DID method
specification is similar to the relationship between the IETF generic URI
specification [[?RFC3986]] and a specific URI scheme [[?IANA-URI-SCHEMES]],
such as the `http` scheme [[?RFC7230]]. In addition to defining a specific DID
scheme, a DID method specification also defines the mechanisms for creating,
resolving, updating, and deactivating DIDs and DID documents using a specific
type of verifiable data registry. It also documents all implementation
considerations related to DIDs as well as Security and Privacy Considerations.

This section specifies the requirements for authoring DID method
specifications.

## Method Syntax

The requirements for all DID method specifications when defining the method-
specific DID Syntax are as follows:

  1. A DID method specification MUST define exactly one method-specific DID scheme that is identified by exactly one method name as specified by the `method-name` rule in . 
  2. The DID method specification MUST specify how to generate the `method-specific-id` component of a DID. 
  3. The DID method specification MUST define sensitivity and normalization of the value of the `method-specific-id`. 
  4. The `method-specific-id` value MUST be unique within a DID method. The `method-specific-id` value itself might be globally unique. 
  5. Any DID generated by a DID method MUST be globally unique. 
  6. To reduce the chances of `method-name` conflicts, a DID method specification SHOULD be registered in the DID Specification Registries [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]. 
  7. A DID method MAY define multiple `method-specific-id` formats. 
  8. The `method-specific-id` format MAY include colons. The use of colons MUST comply syntactically with the `method-specific-id` ABNF rule. 
  9. A DID method specification MAY specify ABNF rules for DID paths that are more restrictive than the generic rules in . 
  10. A DID method specification MAY specify ABNF rules for DID queries that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section. 
  11. A DID method specification MAY specify ABNF rules for DID fragments that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section. 

The meaning of colons in the `method-specific-id` is entirely method-specific.
Colons might be used by DID methods for establishing hierarchically
partitioned namespaces, for identifying specific instances or parts of the
verifiable data registry, or for other purposes. Implementers are advised to
avoid assuming any meanings or behaviors associated with a colon that are
generically applicable to all DID methods.

## Method Operations

The requirements for all DID method specifications when defining the method
operations are as follows:

  1. A DID method specification MUST define how authorization is performed to execute all operations, including any necessary cryptographic processes. 
  2. A DID method specification MUST specify how a DID controller creates a DID and its associated DID document. 
  3. A DID method specification MUST specify how a DID resolver uses a DID to resolve a DID document, including how the DID resolver can verify the authenticity of the response. 
  4. A DID method specification MUST specify what constitutes an update to a DID document and how a DID controller can update a DID document _or_ state that updates are not possible. 
  5. The DID method specification MUST specify how a DID controller can deactivate a DID _or_ state that deactivation is not possible. 

The authority of a party that is performing authorization to carry out the
operations is specific to a DID method. For example, a DID method might --

  * make use of the `controller` property. 
  * use the verification methods listed under `authentication`. 
  * use other constructs in the DID Document such as the verification method specified via the `capabilityInvocation` verification relationship. 
  * not use the DID document for this decision at all, and depend on an out-of-band mechanism, instead. 

## Security Requirements

The requirements for all DID method specifications when authoring the
_Security Considerations_ section are as follows:

  1. A DID method specifications MUST follow all guidelines and normative language provided in RFC3552: Writing Security Considerations Sections for the DID operations defined in the DID method specification. 
  2. The Security Considerations section MUST document the following forms of attack for the DID operations defined in the DID method specification: eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, denial of service, storage or network amplification, and man-in-the-middle. Other known forms of attack SHOULD also be documented. 
  3. The Security Considerations section MUST discuss residual risks, such as the risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation, or cipher after threat mitigation was deployed. 
  4. The Security Considerations section MUST provide integrity protection and update authentication for all operations required by Section . 
  5. If authentication is involved, particularly user-host authentication, the security characteristics of the authentication method MUST be clearly documented. 
  6. The Security Considerations section MUST discuss the policy mechanism by which DIDs are proven to be uniquely assigned. 
  7. Method-specific endpoint authentication MUST be discussed. Where DID methods make use of DLTs with varying network topology, sometimes offered as _light node_ or _[thin client](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security)_ implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security assumptions of the topology available to implementations of the DID method MUST be discussed. 
  8. If a protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, the DID method specification MUST clearly indicate which portions of the data are protected and by what protections, and it SHOULD give an indication of the sorts of attacks to which the cryptographic protection is susceptible. Some examples are integrity only, confidentiality, and endpoint authentication. 
  9. Data which is to be held secret (keying material, random seeds, and so on) SHOULD be clearly labeled. 
  10. DID method specifications SHOULD explain and specify the implementation of signatures on DID documents, if applicable. 
  11. Where DID methods use peer-to-peer computing resources, such as with all known DLTs, the expected burdens of those resources SHOULD be discussed in relation to denial of service. 
  12. DID methods that introduce new authentication service types, as described in , SHOULD consider the security requirements of the supported authentication protocol. 

## Privacy Requirements

The requirements for all DID method specifications when authoring the _Privacy
Considerations_ section are:

  1. The DID method specification's Privacy Considerations section MUST discuss any subsection of Section 5 of [[RFC6973]] that could apply in a method-specific manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored data compromise, unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation, identification, secondary use, disclosure, and exclusion. 

# Security Considerations

During the Working Draft stage, this section focuses on security topics that
should be important in early implementations. The editors are seeking feedback
on threats and threat mitigations that should be reflected in this section or
elsewhere in the spec. DIDs are designed to operate under the general Internet
threat model used by many IETF standards. We assume uncompromised endpoints,
but anticipate that messages could be read or corrupted on the network.

## Choosing DID Resolvers

The DID Method Registry (see [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]]) contains an informative
list of DID method names and their corresponding DID method specifications.
Implementors need to bear in mind that there is no central authority to
mandate which DID method specification is to be used with any specific DID
method name, but can use the DID Method Registry to make an informed decision
when choosing which DID resolver implementations to use.

## Binding of Identity

The following sections describe binding identities to DIDs and DID documents.

### Proving Control of a DID and DID Document

This section is inaccurate and needs revision.

Signatures and verifiable timestamps allow DID documents to be
cryptographically verifiable.

By itself, a verified signature on a self-signed DID document does not prove
control of a DID. It only proves that the:

  * DID document was not tampered with since it was timestamped. 
  * DID controller(s) controlled the private key used for the signature at the time the timestamp was created. 

Proving control of a DID, that is, the binding between the DID and the DID
document that describes it, requires a two step process:

  1. Resolving the DID to a DID document according to its DID method specification. 
  2. Verifying that the `id` property of the resulting DID document matches the DID that was resolved. 

It should be noted that this process proves control of a DID and DID document
regardless of whether the DID document is signed.

Signatures on DID documents are optional. DID method specifications are
expected to explain and specify their implementation if applicable.

### Proving Control of a Public Key

This section is inaccurate and needs revision.

There are two methods for proving control of the private key corresponding to
a public key description in the DID document: static and dynamic.

The static method is to sign the DID document with the private key. This
proves control of the private key at a time no later than the DID document was
registered. If the DID document is not signed, control of a public key
described in the DID document can still be proven dynamically as follows:

  1. Send a challenge message containing a public key description from the DID document and a nonce to an appropriate service endpoint described in the DID document. 
  2. Verify the signature of the response message against the public key description. 

### Real-World Identity

A DID and DID document do not inherently carry any [ personal
data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data).

It can be useful to express a binding of DID to a person's or company's real
world identity, in a way that is provably asserted by a trusted authority such
as a government. This can enable interactions that can be considered legally
valid under one or more jurisdictions; establishing such bindings has to be
carefully balanced against privacy considerations (see ).

The process of binding a DID to something in the real world, such as a person
or a company, for example using verifiable credentials with the same subject
as that DID, is out of scope for this specification. For more information, see
the Verifiable Credentials Data Model [[VC-DATA-MODEL]].

## Authentication Service Endpoints

If a DID document publishes a service intended for authentication or
authorization of the DID subject (see Section ), it is the responsibility of
the service endpoint provider, subject, or requesting party to comply with the
requirements of the authentication protocols supported at that service
endpoint.

## Non-Repudiation

Non-repudiation of DIDs and DID document updates is supported under the
assumption that the subject:

  * Is monitoring for unauthorized updates (see Section ). 
  * Has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious updates according to the access control mechanism for the DID method (see Section ). 

Non-repudiation is further supported if timestamps are included (see Section )
and the target DLT system supports timestamps.

## Notification of DID Document Changes

One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a DID document is monitoring
and actively notifying the DID subject when there are changes. This is
analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to the
email addresses on file.

In the case of a DID, there is no intermediary registrar or account provider
to generate such notifications. However, if the verifiable data registry on
which the DID is registered directly supports change notifications, a
subscription service can be offered to DID controllers. Notifications could be
sent directly to the relevant service endpoints listed in an existing DID.

If a DID controller chooses to rely on a third-party monitoring service (other
than the verifiable data registry itself), this introduces another vector of
attack.

## Key and Signature Expiration

In a decentralized identifier architecture, there are no centralized
authorities to enforce key or signature expiration policies. Therefore DID
resolvers and requesting parties need to validate that keys were not expired
at the time they were used. Because some use cases have legitimate reasons why
already-expired keys can be extended, make sure key expiration does not
prevent any further use of the key. Implementations of a resolver ought to be
compatible with such extension behavior.

## Verification Method Rotation

Verification method rotation is a proactive security measure.

Verification method rotation applies only to the current or latest version of
a DID Document.

When a verification method has been active for a long time, or used for many
operations, a controller might wish to perform a rotation.

It is considered a best practice to perform verification method rotation on a
regular basis.

Proofs or signatures that rely on verification methods that are not present in
the latest version of a DID Document are not impacted by rotation, and might
require additional information to mitigate compromise.

Section  specifies the DID operations to be supported by a DID method
specification, including update which is expected to be used to perform a
verification method rotation.

A controller performs a rotation when they add a new verification method that
is meant to replace an existing verification method after some time.

Not all DID Methods support verification method rotation.

Rotation is a key management process that enables the private cryptographic
material associated with an existing verification method to be deactivated or
destroyed once a new verification method has been added to the DID Document.
Going forward, any new proofs that a controller would have generated using the
old cryptographic material can now instead be generated using the new material
and can be verified using the new verification method.

Rotation is a useful mechanism for protecting against verification method
compromise, since frequent rotation of a verification method by the controller
reduces the value of a single compromised verification method to an attacker.
Performing revocation immediately after rotation is useful for verification
methods that a controller designates for short-lived verifications, such as
those involved in encrypting messages and authentication.

Higher security environments tend to employ more frequent verification method
rotation.

Frequent rotation of a verification method might be frustrating for parties
that are forced to continuously renew or refresh associated credentials.

## Verification Method Revocation

Verification method revocation is a reactive security measure.

Verification method revocation applies only to the current or latest version
of a DID Document.

If a verification method is no longer exclusively accessible to the controller
or parties trusted to act on behalf of the controller, it is expected to be
revoked immediately to reduce the risk of masquerading, theft, and fraud.

It is considered a best practice to support key revocation.

A controller is expected to immediately revoke any verification method that is
believed to be compromised.

Revocation is expected to be understood as a controller expressing that proofs
or signatures associated with a revoked verification method might have been
created by an attacker. Verifiers, however, might still choose to accept or
reject such proofs or signatures at their own discretion.

As described in , absence of a verification method is the only form of
revocation that applies to all DID Methods.

specifies the DID operations to be supported by a DID method specification,
including update and  deactivate which might be used to remove verification
method from a DID Document.

Not all DID Methods support verification method revocation.

Even if a verification method is present in a DID Document, additional
information, such as a public key revocation certificate, or an external allow
or deny list, might be used to determine whether a verification method has
been revoked.

Compromise of the secrets associated with a verification method allows the
attacker to use them according to the verification relationship expressed by
controller in the DID Document, for example, for authentication. The
attacker's use of the secrets might be indistinguishable from the legitimate
controller's use starting from the time the verification method was
registered, to the time it was revoked.

The day-to-day operation of any software relying on a compromised verification
method, such as an individual's operating system, antivirus, or endpoint
protection software, might be impacted when the verification method is
publicly revoked.

Although verifiers might choose not to accept proofs or signatures from a
revoked verification method, knowing whether a verification was made with a
revoked verification method is trickier than it might seem. Some DID methods
provide the ability to look back at the state of a DID at a point in time, or
at a particular version of the DID document. When such a feature is combined
with a reliable way to determine the time or DID version that existed when a
cryptographically verifiable statement was made, then revocation does not undo
that statement. This can be the basis for using DIDs to make binding
commitments (e.g., to sign a mortgage).  
  
If these conditions are met, revocation is not retroactive; it only nullifies
future use of the method.  
  
However, in order for such semantics to be safe, the second condition -- an
ability to know what the state of the DID document was at the time the
assertion was made -- is expected to apply. Without that guarantee, someone
could discover a revoked key and use it to make cryptographically verifiable
statements with a simulated date in the past.  
  
Some DID methods only allow the retrieval of the current state of a DID. When
this is true, or when the state of a DID at the time of cryptographically
verifiable statement cannot be reliably determined, then the only safe
interpretation of revocation is to make it apply both forward and backward in
time. DID ecosystems that take this approach essentially provide
cryptographically verifiable statements as ephemeral tokens that can be
invalidated at any time by the DID controller.

## DID Recovery

Recovery is a reactive security measure, whereby a controller is able to
regain the ability to perform DID operations.

Recovery is advised when a controller or services trusted to act on their
behalf no longer have the exclusive ability to perform DID operations as
described in .

It is considered a best practice to never reuse a verification method or key
material associated with recovery for any other purposes.

Recovery is commonly performed in conjunction with verification method
rotation and verification method revocation.

There are no common recovery mechanisms that apply to all DID Methods.

DID method specifications might choose to enable support for a quorum of
trusted parties to faciliate recovery. Some of the facilities to do so are
suggested in Section .

Not all DID method specifications will recognize control from DIDs registered
using other DID methods and they might restrict third-party control to DIDs
that use the same method.

Access control and recovery in a DID method specification can also include a
time lock feature to protect against key compromise by maintaining a second
track of control for recovery.

Performing recovery proactively on an infrequent but regular basis, can help
to ensure that control has not been lost.

## The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers

DIDs achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central registration
authority. This comes at the cost of human memorability. The algorithms
capable of generating globally unique identifiers produce random strings of
characters that have no human meaning (see also [Zooko's
Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle)).

There are use cases where it is desirable to discover a DID when starting from
a human-friendly identifier. For example, a natural language name, a domain
name, or a conventional address for a DID controller, such as a mobile
telephone number, email address, social media username, or blog URL. However,
the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to DIDs (and doing so in a
way that can be verified and trusted) is outside the scope of this
specification.

Solutions to this problem should be defined in separate specifications that
reference this specification. It is strongly recommended that such
specifications carefully consider the:

  * Numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly identifier for a target entity. 
  * Privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently correlatable, especially if they are globally unique. 

A draft specification for discovering a DID from domain names and email
addresses using DNS lookups is available at [[?DNS-DID]].

## DIDs as Enhanced URNs

If desired by a DID controller, a DID is capable of acting as an enhanced
Uniform Resource Name (URN) as defined by [[RFC8141]], i.e., "a persistent,
location-independent resource identifier". DIDs used in this way provide a
cryptographically secure, location-independent identifier for a digital
resource, while also providing metadata that enables retrieval. Because of the
indirection between the DID document and the DID itself, the DID controller
can adjust the actual location of the resource -- or even provide the resource
directly -- without adjusting the DID. DIDs of this type can definitively
verify that the resource retrieved is, in fact, the resource identified.

A DID controller who intends to use a DID for this purpose is advised to
follow the security considerations in [[RFC8141]]. In particular:

  * The DID controller is expected to choose a DID method that supports the controller's requirements for persistence. The Decentralized Characteristics Rubric [[?DID-RUBRIC]] is one tool available to help implementers decide upon the most suitable DID method. 
  * The DID controller is expected to publish its operational policies so relying parties can determine the degree to which they can rely on the persistence of a DID controlled by that DID controller. In the absence of such policies, relying parties are not expected to make any assumption about whether a DID is a persistent identifier for the same DID subject. 

## Immutability

Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and the
assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Immutability of DID documents can
provide some security benefits. Individual DID methods ought to consider
constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics they do not need. The
more _locked down_ a DID method is, while providing the same set of features,
the less it can be manipulated by malicious actors.

As an example, consider that a single edit to a DID document can change
anything except the root `id` property of the document. But is it actually
desirable for a service to change its `type` after it is defined? Or for a key
to change its value? Or would it be better to require a new `id` when certain
fundamental properties of an object change? Malicious takeovers of a website
often aim for an outcome where the site keeps its identifier (the host name),
but is subtly changed underneath. If certain properties of the site were
required by the specification to be immutable (for example, the
[ASN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_\(Internet\)) associated
with its IP address), such attacks might be much harder and more expensive to
carry out, and anomaly detection would be easier.

For DID methods tied to a global source of truth, a direct, just-in-time
lookup of the latest version of a DID document is always possible. However, it
seems likely that layers of cache might eventually sit between a DID resolver
and that source of truth. If they do, believing the attributes of an object in
the DID document to have a given state when they are actually subtly different
might invite exploits. This is particularly true if some lookups are of a full
DID document, and others are of partial data where the larger context is
assumed.

## Encrypted Data in DID Documents

Encryption algorithms have been known to fail due to advances in cryptography
and computing power. Implementers are advised to assume that any encrypted
data placed in a DID document might eventually be made available in clear text
to the same audience to which the encrypted data is available. This is
particularly pertinent if the DID document is public.

Encrypting all or parts of DID documents is _not_ an appropriate means to
protect data in the long term. Similarly, placing encrypted data in DID
documents is not an appropriate means to include personal data.

Given the caveats above, if encrypted data is included in a DID document,
implementers are advised to not encrypt with the public keys of entities that
do not wish to be correlated with the DID.

## Equivalence Properties

The three equivalence properties—`alsoKnownAs`, `equivalentId`, and
`canonicalId`—are subject to special security considerations related to
attacks against DIDs that are asserted to be equivalent.

The `equivalentId` and `canonicalId` properties that constrain equivalence
assertions to variants of a single DID produced by the same DID method (e.g.,
`did:foo:123` ≡ `did:foo:hash(123)`) can be trusted to the extent the
requesting party trusts the DID method (and a conforming producer) itself.

The `alsoKnownAs` property that permits an equivalence assertion to URIs that
are not governed by the same DID method (or may not be DIDs at all) cannot be
trusted without performing verification steps outside of the governing DID
method. See additional guidence in .

As with any other sensitive properties in the DID document (e.g., public key
references), parties relying on any equivalence statement in a DID document
should guard against the values of these properties being substituted by an
attacker after the proper verification has been performed. Any write access to
a DID document stored in memory or disk after verification has been performed
is an attack vector that will circumvent verification unless the DID document
is re-verified.

## Content Integrity Protection

DID documents which include external JSON-LD contexts (see ) or any other
links to external machine-readable content are vulnerable to tampering.

DID document consumers can cache local static copies of JSON-LD contexts
and/or verify the integrity of external contexts against the cryptographic
hash for the context as registered in the DID Specification Registries (see
the registration process for more detail) [[?DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].

## Persistence

DIDs are designed to be persistent such that a controller need not rely upon a
single trusted third party or administrator to maintain their identifiers. No
administrator can take control away from the controller, nor can an
administrator prevent their identifiers' use for any particular purpose such
as authentication, authorization, and attestation. No third party can act on
behalf of a controller to remove or render inoperable an individual's (or an
organization's) identifier without the controller's consent.

However, it is important to note that in all DID Methods that enable
cryptographic proof-of-control, the means of proving control can always be
transferred to another party by transferring the cryptographic secrets.
Therefore, it is vital that systems relying on the persistence of an
identifier over time regularly check to ensure that the identifier is, in
fact, still under the control of the intended party.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine from the cryptography alone
whether or not the private key material associated with a given proof
mechanism has been compromised. It might well be that the expected controller
still has access to the private keys -- and as such can execute a proof-of-
control as part of a verification process -- while at the same time, a bad
actor also has access to (or a copy of) those same keys.

As such, cryptographic proof-of-control is expected to only be used as one
factor in evaluating the level of identity assurance for a given service. DID-
based authentication provides much greater assurance than a username and
password, thanks to the ability to determine control over a secret without
transmitting that secret between systems. However, it is not infallible.
Services that perform sensitive, high value, or life-critical operations
should use additional factors as appropriate.

In addition to potential ambiguity from use by different controllers, it is
impossible to guarantee, in general, that a given DID is being used in
reference to the same subject at any given point in time. It is technically
possible for the controller to reuse a DID for different subjects and, more
subtly, for the precise definition of the Subject to either change over time
or be misunderstood.

For example, consider a DID used for a sole proprietership, receiving various
credentials used for financial transactions. To the controller, that
identifier referred to the business. As the business grows, it eventually gets
incorporated as an LLC. The controller continues using that same DID, because
to **them** the DID refers to the business. However, to the state, the tax
authority, and the local municipality, the DID no longer refers to the same
entity. Whether or not the subtle shift in meaning matters to a credit
provider or supplier is necessarily up to them to decide. In many cases, as
long as the bills get paid and collections can be enforced, the shift is
immaterial.

Because of these potential ambiguities, DIDs should be considered valid
_contextually_ rather than absolutely. Their persistence does not imply that
they refer to the exact same Subject, nor that they are under the control of
the same controller. Instead, one needs to understand the context in which the
DID was created, how it is used, and consider the likely shifts in their
meaning, and adopt procedures and policies to address both potential and
inevitable semantic drift.

## Level of Assurance

Additional information about the security context of authentication events is
often required for compliance reasons, especially in regulated areas such as
the financial and public sectors. Examples include but are not limited to
protection of secret keys, the identity proofing process, and the form-factor
of the authenticator. For example, [ Payment services (PSD
2)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-
eu-2015-2366_en) and [ eIDAS](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG) introduce such
requirements to the security context. Level of Assurance (LoA) frameworks are
classified and defined by, for example, [ eIDAS](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG), [ NIST
800-63-3](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html) and [ ISO/IEC
29115:2013](https://www.iso.org/standard/45138.html), including their
requirements for the security context, and making recommendations on how to
achieve them. This might include strong user authentication and
[FIDO2](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2)/[WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/)
can be potential implementations. A LoA represents the level of confidence
that an entity is in fact that entity. Some regulated use cases require the
implementation of a certain LoA. Since verification relationships such as `
assertionMethod` and `authentication` might be used in some of these use
cases, information about the applied security context might need to be
expressed and provided to a _verifier_. Whether and how to encode this
information in the DID document data model is out of scope for this
specification, but it should be noted that the DID document data model can be
extended if necessary (see Extensibility section). Section Privacy
Considerations remains applicable for such extensions.

# Privacy Considerations

It is critically important to apply the principles of Privacy by Design
[[PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN]] to all aspects of the decentralized identifier
architecture, because DIDs and DID documents are, by design, administered
directly by the DID controller(s). There is no registrar, hosting company, or
other intermediate service provider to recommend or apply additional privacy
safeguards. The authors of this specification have applied all seven Privacy
by Design principles throughout its development. Privacy in this specification
is preventative not remedial, and privacy is an embedded default.

## Keep Personal Data Private

If a DID method specification is written for a public verifiable data registry
where all DIDs and DID documents are publicly available, it is _critical_ that
DID documents contain no personal data.

Personal data can instead be placed behind service endpoints under control of
the DID subject or DID controller. Due diligence should be taken around the
use of URLs in service endpoints to prevent leakage of personal data or
correlation within a URL of a service endpoint. For example, a URL that
contains a username is dangerous to include in a DID Document because the
username is likely to be human-meaningful in a way that can reveal information
that the DID subject did not consent to sharing. With this privacy
architecture, personal data can be exchanged on a private, peer-to-peer basis
using communications channels identified and secured by public key
descriptions in DID documents. This also enables DID subjects and requesting
parties to implement the
[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)
[right to be forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten),
because no personal data is written to an immutable distributed ledger.

## DID Correlation Risks and Pseudonymous DIDs

Like any type of globally unique identifier, DIDs might be used for
correlation. DID controllers can mitigate this privacy risk by using pairwise
unique DIDs, that is, sharing a different private DID for every relationship.
In effect, each DID acts as a pseudonym. A pseudonymous DID need only be
shared with more than one party when the DID subject explicitly authorizes
correlation between those parties. If pseudonymous DIDs are the default, then
the only need for a public DID (a DID published openly or shared with a large
number of parties) is when the DID subject explicitly desires public
identification.

## DID Document Correlation Risks

The anti-correlation protections of pseudonymous DIDs are easily defeated if
the data in the corresponding DID documents can be correlated. For example,
using same public key descriptions or bespoke service endpoints in multiple
DID documents can provide as much correlation information as using the same
DID. Therefore the DID document for a pseudonymous DID also needs to use
pairwise unique public keys. It might seem natural to also use pairwise unique
service endpoints in the DID document for a pseudonymous DID. However, unique
endpoints allow all traffic between two DIDs to be isolated perfectly into
unique buckets, where timing correlation and similar analysis is easy.
Therefore, a better strategy for endpoint privacy might be to share an
endpoint among thousands or millions of DIDs controlled by many different
subjects. See also .

## Assigning a type to the DID subject

It is dangerous to add properties to the DID document that can be used to
indicate, explicitly or through inference, what _type_ or nature of thing the
DID subject is, particularly if the DID subject is a person.

Not only do such properties potentially result in personal data (see ) or
correlatable data (see  and ) being present in the DID document, but they can
be used for grouping particular DIDs in such a way that they are included in
or excluded from certain operations or functionalities.

Including _type_ information in a DID Document can result in personal privacy
harms even for DID Subjects that are non-person entities, such as IoT devices.
The aggregation of such information around a DID Controller could serve as a
form of digital fingerprint and this is best avoided.

To minimize these risks, all properties in a DID document ought to be for
expressing cryptographic material, endpoints, or verification methods related
to using the DID.

## Herd Privacy

When a DID subject is indistinguishable from others in the herd, privacy is
available. When the act of engaging privately with another party is by itself
a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished.

DIDs and DID methods need to work to improve herd privacy, particularly for
those who legitimately need it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces
that default to preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. To reduce [digital
fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint), share common
settings across requesting party implementations, keep negotiated options to a
minimum on wire protocols, use encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to
standard lengths.

## Service Privacy

The ability for a controller to optionally state at least one service endpoint
in the DID document increases their control and agency. Each additional
endpoint in the DID document adds privacy risk either due to correlation
(e.g., across endpoint descriptions) or because the services are not protected
by an authorization mechanism, or both.

DID documents are often public and will be stored and indexed efficiently by
their very standards-based nature. This risk is worse if DID documents are
published to immutable Verifiable Data Registries. Access to a history of the
DID documents referenced by a DID represents a form of traffic analysis made
more efficient through the use of standards.

The degree of additional privacy risk caused by using multiple service
endpoints in one DID document can be difficult to estimate. Privacy harms are
typically unintended consequences. DIDs can identify documents, services,
schemas, and other things that may be associated with individual people,
households, clubs, and employers -- and correlation of their service endpoints
could become a powerful surveillance and inference tool. An example of this is
that including multiple common country-level top level domain such as
`https://example.co.uk` could be used to infer the approximate location of the
DID Subject with a greater degree of probability.

The variety of possible endpoints makes it particularly challenging to
maintain herd privacy, in which no information about the DID subject is
leaked.

First, because service endpoints may be specified as URIs, they could
unintentionally leak personal information because of the architecture of the
service. For example, a service endpoint of `http://example.com/MyFirstName`
is leaking the term `MyFirstName` to everyone who can access the DID Document.
When linking to legacy systems, this is an unavoidable risk and care should be
taken in such cases. We encourage new, DID-aware endpoints to use nothing more
than the DID itself for any identification necessary, e.g.,
`http://example.com/did%3Aexample%3Aabc123`. Since that `did:example:abc123`
is already exposed in the DID Document, it leaks no additional information.

Second, because a DID document can list multiple service endpoints, it is
possible to irreversibly associate services that are not associated in any
other context. This correlation on its own may lead to de-anonymization,
revealing information about the DID subject even if the URIs used did not.

Third, because some types of DID subjects may be more or less likely to list
specific endpoints, e.g., a DID for an automobile may include a pointer to a
public title record at the Department of Motor Vehicles, while a DID for an
individual would not. As such, the listing of a given service could, by
itself, leak information that can be used to infer something about the
subject.

It is the goal of herd privacy to ensure that the nature of specific subjects
is obscured by the population of the whole. To maximize herd privacy,
implementers need to rely on one -- and only one -- service endpoint, with
that endpoint providing a proxy or mediator service that the controller is
willing to depend on to protect such associations and that blinds requests to
the ultimate service.

Torward this end, consider any of the following:

  * **Negotiator Endpoint** -- Service for negotiating mutually agreeable communications channels, preferably using private set intersection. The output of negotiation is a communication channel and whatever credentials may be needed to access it. 
  * **Tor Endpoint** ([Tor Onion Router](https://www.torproject.org/about/history/)) -- Provide a privacy-respecting address for reaching service endpoints. Any service that can be provided online can be provided through TOR for additional privacy.
  * **Mediator Endpoint** -- [Mediators](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/720bdab50e2d0437fda03028c1b17c69781bdd69/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays/README.md) provide a generic endpoint, for multiple parties, receive encrypted messages on behalf of those parties, and forward them to the intended recipient. This avoids the need to have a specific endpoint per subject, which could create a correlation risk. Also called a proxy. 
  * **Confidential Storage** -- Proprietary or confidential personal information may need to be kept off-registry to provide additional privacy and/or security guarantees, especially for those methods where DID documents are published on a public ledger. Pointing to external resource services provides a means for authorization checks and deletion. 
  * **Polymorphic Proxy** -- A proxy endpoint that can act as any number of services, depending on how it is called. For example, the same URL could be used for both negotiator and mediator functions, depending on a mechanism for re-routing. 

These service endpoint types continue to be an area of innovation.

practice to avoid using the same verification method for multiple purposes.

# Frequently Asked Questions about DID Identification

## What types of resources can a DID identify?

Since a DID is a specific type of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), the
answer to this question is provided by section 1.1 of the URI specification
[[!RFC3986]]:

> This specification does not limit the scope of what might be a resource;
> rather, the term "resource" is used in a general sense for whatever might be
> identified by a URI. Familiar examples include an electronic document, an
> image, a source of information with a consistent purpose (e.g., "today's
> weather report for Los Angeles"), a service (e.g., an HTTP-to-SMS gateway),
> and a collection of other resources. A resource is not necessarily
> accessible via the Internet; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound
> books in a library can also be resources. Likewise, abstract concepts can be
> resources, such as the operators and operands of a mathematical equation,
> the types of a relationship (e.g., "parent" or "employee"), or numeric
> values (e.g., zero, one, and infinity).

In other words, it does not matter whether a resource is "on" or "off" the
Internet—if it can be identified, it can be assigned a URI, and therefore it
can be assigned a DID.

## How do you know what a DID identifies?

For any DID, the DID controller determines the DID subject. It is not expected
to be possible to determine the DID subject from looking at the DID itself.
The reason is that, in order to satisfy several core properties of a DID as an
identifier—especially decentralization and cryptographic verifiability—DIDs
are generally only meaningful to machines, not humans. To illustrate, compare
the following two URIs:

`did:example:8uQhQMGzWxR8vw5P3UWH1j`

The first is the URL of the Getting Started page of the W3C DID Working Group.
This is a human-meaningful identifier (at least to someone who understands the
English language). In this sense, the reader can be said to "know" what the
URL identifies without having to dereference it (provided the reader trusts
the publisher of the URL).

The second URI—the example DID—is meaningless to humans no matter what
language you speak. What it identifies is anyone’s guess in the absence of
further information describing the DID subject. So further information about
the DID subject is only discoverable by resolving the DID to the DID document,
obtaining a verifiable credential about the DID, or via some other description
of the DID.

## Does the DID identify the DID document?

No. To be very precise, the DID identifies the DID subject and _resolves to_
the DID document (by following the protocol specified by the DID method). The
DID document is not a separate resource from the DID subject and does not have
a URI separate from the DID. Rather the DID document is an artifact of DID
resolution controlled by the DID controller for the purpose of describing the
DID subject.

This distinction is illustrated by the graph model shown below.

        ](diagrams/figure-a.1-did-and-did-document-graph.png) A DID is an identifier assigned by a DID controller to identify a DID subject and resolve to a DID document that describes the DID subject. The DID document is an artifact of DID resolution and not a separate resource distinct from the DID subject. 

## What does the DID document say about the DID subject?

Each property in a DID document is a statement by the DID controller that
refers to:

  * The string of characters defining identifiers for the DID subject (e.g., the `id` and `alsoKnownAs` properties) 
  * How to interact with the DID subject (e.g., the `verificationMethod` and `service` properties). 
  * How to interpret the specific representation of the DID document (e.g., the `@context` property for a JSON-LD representation). 

There is only one required property in a DID document—the `id` property—so
that is the only statement guaranteed to be in a DID document. That statement
is illustrated by the solid red arrow in figure 2 asserting that the DID
identifies the DID subject.

## How can you discover more information about the DID subject?

There are two basic options for discovery of more information about the DID
subject. The first option is to request more information from a service
endpoint if one or more are present in the DID document. An example would be
to query a service endpoint that supports verifiable credentials for one or
more claims (attributes) describing the DID subject.

A second option is to use the `alsoKnownAs` property if it is present in the
DID document. The DID controller can use it to provide a list of other URIs
(including other DIDs) that identify the same DID subject. Resolving or
dereferencing these URIs might yield other descriptions or representations of
the DID subject as illustrated in the figure below.

          alsoKnownAs property with an arc to another node representing a
          different resource that dereferences to another description of the
          DID subject.
        ](diagrams/figure-a.2-also-known-as-graph.png) A DID document can use the alsoKnownAs property to assert another URI (including another DID) that identifies the same DID subject

This mechanism is how DID identification can fulfill guidance from the W3C in
[Cool URIs for the Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/):

> Given only a URI, machines and people should be able to retrieve a
> description about the resource identified by the URI from the Web. Such a
> look-up mechanism is important to establish shared understanding of what a
> URI identifies. Machines should get RDF data and humans should get a
> readable representation, such as HTML.

Note that it is not required that a DID document use an RDF-based
representation; see .

## Can the DID document serve as a representation of the DID subject?

If the DID subject is a digital resource that can be retrieved from the
Internet, then yes, the DID document can serve as a representation of the DID
subject. For example, a data schema that needs a persistent, cryptographically
verifiable identifier could be assigned a DID, and its DID document could be
used as a standard way to retrieve a representation of that schema.

Alternately, a DID can be used to identify a digital resource that can be
returned directly from a verifiable data registry if that functionality is
supported by the applicable DID method.

## Can existing web resources also be assigned DIDs?

Yes, if the controller of a web page or any other web resource wants to assign
it a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier, the controller can
give it a DID. For example, the author of a blog hosted by a blog hosting
company (under that hosting company’s own URL) could create a DID for the
blog. In the DID document, the author can include an alsoKnownAs property
pointing to the current URL of the blog:

` "alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.blogging-host.example/home"] `

If the author subsequently moves the blog to a different hosting company (or
to the author’s own domain), the author can update the DID document to point
to the new URL for the blog:

` "alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.example/"] `

The DID effectively adds a layer of indirection for the blog URL. This layer
of indirection is under the control of the author instead of under the control
of an external administrative authority such as the blog hosting company. This
is how a DID can effectively function as an enhanced [URN (Uniform Resource
Name)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141)—a persistent identifier for an
information resource whose network location might change over time.

## What is the relationship between DID controllers and DID subjects?

To avoid confusion, it is helpful to classify DID subjects into two disjoint
sets based on their relationship to the DID controller.

### Set #1: The DID subject _is_ the DID controller

The first case, shown in figure 4, is the common scenario where the DID
subject is also the DID controller. This is the case when an individual or
organization creates a DID to self-identify.

![

            Diagram showing the same graph model as figure 2 except with an
            equivalence arc from the DID subject to the DID controller.
          ](diagrams/figure-b.1-controller-and-subject-equivalence.png) The DID subject is the same entity as the DID controller

From a graph model perspective, even though the nodes identified as the DID
controller and DID subject in figure 4 are distinct, there is a logical arc
connecting them to express a semantic equivalence relationship. (In RDF/OWL,
this is expressed using the [ `owl:sameAs`
predicate](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#sameAs-def).)

### Set #2: The DID subject is _not_ the DID controller

The second case is when the DID subject is a separate entity from the DID
controller. This is the case when, for example, a parent creates and maintains
control of a DID for a child; a corporation creates and maintains control of a
DID for a subsidiary; or a manufacturer creates and maintains control of a DID
for a product, an IoT device, or a digital file.

From a graph model perspective, the only difference from Set 1 that there is
no equivalence arc relationship between the DID subject and DID controller
nodes.

## Can a DID document have multiple DID Controllers?

Yes. A DID document might have more than one DID controller. In this situation
there are two basic options available for how control can be shared.

### Option #1: Independent Control

In the first option, shown in the figure below, each of the DID controllers
might act on its own, i.e., each one has full power to update the DID document
independently. From a graph model perspective, in this configuration:

  * Each additional DID controller is another distinct graph node (which might be identified by its own DID). 
  * The same arcs ("controls" and "controller") exist between each DID controller and the DID document.

            control relationship with the DID document
          ](diagrams/figure-c.1-independent-did-controllers.png) Multiple independent DID controllers that can each act independently 

### Option #2: Group Control

In the second option, the DID controllers are expected to act together in some
fashion, such as when using a cryptographic algorithm that requires multiple
digital signatures ("multi-sig") or a threshold number of digital signatures
("m-of-n"). From a functional standpoint, this option is similar to a single
DID controller because, although each of the DID controllers in the DID
controller group has its own graph node, the actual control collapses into a
single logical graph node representing the DID controller group as shown in
this figure:

            DID controller group to control a DID document
          ](diagrams/figure-c.2-group-did-controllers.png) Multiple DID controllers who are expected to act together as a DID controller group 

This configuration will often apply when the DID subject is an organization,
corporation, government agency, community, or other group that is not
controlled by a single individual.
