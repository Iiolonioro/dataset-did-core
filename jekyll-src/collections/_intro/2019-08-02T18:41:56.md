Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for
verifiable, "self-sovereign" digital identity. DIDs are fully under the
control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry,
identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs are URLs that relate
a DID subject to means for trustable interactions with that subject.
DIDs resolve to DID Documents â€” simple documents that describe how to
use that specific DID. Each DID Document may contain at least three
things: proof purposes, verification methods, and service endpoints.
Proof purposes are combined with verification methods to provide mechanisms
for proving things. For example, a DID Document can specify that a particular
verification method, such as a cryptographic public key or pseudonymous
biometric protocol, can be used to verify a proof that was created for the
purpose of authentication. Service endpoints enable trusted interactions with
the DID controller.
    </p>
<p>
This document specifies a common data model, format, and operations
that all DIDs support.
