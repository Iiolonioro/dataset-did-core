<section id="abstract">
<p>
<a>Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for
verifiable, decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers
are designed to enable the controller of a <a>DID</a> to prove control over
it and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry,
identity provider, or certificate authority. <a>DIDs</a> are URLs that relate
a <a>DID subject</a> to means for trustable interactions with that subject.
<a>DIDs</a> resolve to <a>DID documents</a> â€” simple documents that describe how
to use that specific <a>DID</a>. Each <a>DID document</a> may express cryptographic
material, verification methods, and/or <a>service endpoints</a>. These provide
a set of mechanisms which enable a <a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the
<a>DID</a>. <a>Service endpoints</a> enable trusted interactions with the <a>DID
subject</a>.
    </p>
<p>
This document specifies a common data model, format, and operations that
all <a>DIDs</a> support.
