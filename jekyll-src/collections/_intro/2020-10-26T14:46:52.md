<section id="abstract">
<p>
<a>Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A <a>DID</a> identifies any
subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)
that the controller of the <a>DID</a> decides that it identifies.

In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed
so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers,
and certificate authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used
to help enable the discovery of information related to a <a>DID</a>,
the design enables the controller of a <a>DID</a> to prove control over it
without requiring permission from any other party.

<a>DID</a>s are URIs that associate a <a>DID subject</a> with a <a>DID
document</a> allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.
Each <a>DID document</a> can express cryptographic material, verification
methods, or <a>service endpoints</a>, which provide a set of mechanisms
enabling a <a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the <a>DID</a>.
<a>Service endpoints</a> enable trusted interactions associated with the
<a>DID subject</a>. A <a>DID document</a> might contain the <a>DID subject</a>
itself, if the <a>DID subject</a> is an information resource such as a data model.
    </p>
<p>
This document specifies a common data model, a URL format, and a set of
operations for <a>DIDs</a>, <a>DID documents</a>, and <a>DID methods</a>.
