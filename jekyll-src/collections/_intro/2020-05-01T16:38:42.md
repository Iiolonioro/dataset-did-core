<section id="abstract">
<p class="issue">
This document is undergoing a major structural refactoring and will not be easy
to read. A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/WD-did-core-20191209/">previously
published version</a> that has a better topical flow may be a better read for
people new to this work. When this document has been updated to have a
better flow, this comment will be removed.
    </p>
<p>
<a>Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A <a>DID</a> identifies
any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)
that the controller of the <a>DID</a> decides that it
identifies. These new identifiers are designed to enable the controller
of a <a>DID</a> to prove control over it and to be implemented independently
of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority.
<a>DID</a>s are URLs that associate a <a>DID subject</a> with a
<a>DID document</a> allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.
Each <a>DID document</a> can express cryptographic material, verification methods,
or <a>service endpoints</a>, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a
<a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the <a>DID</a>. <a>Service
endpoints</a> enable trusted interactions associated with the <a>DID
subject</a>. A <a>DID document</a> might contain semantics about the subject
that it identifies. A <a>DID document</a> might contain the <a>DID subject</a>
itself (e.g. a data model).
    </p>
<p>
This document specifies a common data model, a URL format, and a set of
operations for <a>DIDs</a>, <a>DID documents</a>, and <a>DID methods</a>.
