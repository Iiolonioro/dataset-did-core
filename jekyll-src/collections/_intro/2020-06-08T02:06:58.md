<section id="abstract">
<p>
<a>Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A <a>DID</a> identifies any
subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)
that the controller of the <a>DID</a> decides that it identifies. These new
identifiers are designed to enable the controller of a <a>DID</a> to prove
control over it and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry,
identity provider, or certificate authority. <a>DID</a>s are URLs that associate
a <a>DID subject</a> with a <a>DID document</a> allowing trustable interactions
associated with that subject. Each <a>DID document</a> can express cryptographic
material, verification methods, or <a>service endpoints</a>, which provide a set
of mechanisms enabling a <a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the
<a>DID</a>. <a>Service endpoints</a> enable trusted interactions associated with
the <a>DID subject</a>. A <a>DID document</a> might contain semantics about the
subject that it identifies. A <a>DID document</a> might contain the <a>DID
subject</a> itself (e.g. a data model).
    </p>
<p>
This document specifies a common data model, a URL format, and a set of
operations for <a>DIDs</a>, <a>DID documents</a>, and <a>DID methods</a>.
