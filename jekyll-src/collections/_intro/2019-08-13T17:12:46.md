<p>
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for
verifiable, decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers
are designed to enable the controller of a DID to prove control over
it and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry,
identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs are URLs that relate
a <a>DID subject</a> to means for trustable interactions with that subject.
DIDs resolve to DID Documents â€” simple documents that describe how to
use that specific DID. Each DID Document may express cryptographic
material, verification methods, and/or service endpoints. These provide
a set of mechanisms which enable a <a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the
DID. Service endpoints enable trusted interactions with the <a>DID subject</a>.
    </p>
<p>
This document specifies a common data model, format, and operations that
all DIDs support.
