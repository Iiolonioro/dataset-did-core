Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier intended
for verifiable digital identity that is "self-sovereign", i.e., fully
under the control of an entity and not dependent on a
centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs
resolve to DID Documents â€” simple documents that contain all the metadata
needed to interact with the DID. Specifically, a DID Document typically
contains at least three things. The first is a set of mechanisms that may be
used to authenticate as as a particular DID (e.g. public keys,
pseudonymous biometric templates, etc.).
The second is a set of authorization information that outlines which entities
may modify the DID Document. The third is a set of service endpoints, which
may be used to initiate trusted interactions with the entity.
This document specifies a common data model, format, and operations that
all DIDs support.
