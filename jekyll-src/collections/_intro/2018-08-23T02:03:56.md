Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for
verifiable, "self-sovereign" digital identity. DIDs are fully under the
control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry,
identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs are URLs that relate
a DID subject to means for trustable interactions with that subject.
DIDs resolve to DID Documents â€” simple documents that describe how to
use that specific DID. Each DID Document contains at least three
things: cryptographic material, authentication suites, and service
endpoints. Cryptographic material combined with authentication suites
provide a set of mechanisms to authenticate as the DID subject (e.g.
public keys, pseudonymous biometric protocols, etc.). Service endpoints
enable trusted interactions with the DID subject.
    </p>
<p>
This document specifies a common data model, format, and operations
that all DIDs support.
