Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for
verifiable, "self-sovereign" digital identity. DIDs are fully under the
control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry,
identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs are URLs that relate a
DID subject to means for trustable interactions with that subject. DIDs
resolve to DID Documents â€” simple documents that describe how to use that
specific DID. Each DID Document contains at least three things:
cryptographic material, authentication suites, and service endpoints.
Cryptographic material combined with authentication suites provide a set of
mechanisms to authenticate as the DID subject (e.g. public keys,
pseudonymous biometric templates, etc.). Service endpoints enable
trusted interactions with the DID subject.
      </p>
<p>
This document specifies a common data model, format, and operations that all
DIDs support.
