Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier intended
for verifiable digital identity that is "self-sovereign", i.e., fully
under the control of the identity owner and not dependent on a
centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority. DIDs
resolve to DID Objects â€” simple JSON documents that
contain all the metadata needed to interact with the DID.
Specifically, a DID Object contains at least three things. The first is
a set of mechanisms that may be used to authenticate as
as a particular DID (e.g. public keys, pseudonymous biometric templates, etc.).
The second is a set of authorization information that outlines which entities
may modify the DID Object. The third is a set of service endpoints, which may
be used to initiate trusted interactions with the identity owner. Each DID
uses a specific DID method, defined in a separate DID method specification, to
define how the DID is registered, resolved, updated, and revoked on a
specific distributed ledger or network.
