<section id="abstract">
<p>
<a>Decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) are a new type of identifier to
provide verifiable, decentralized digital identity. These new identifiers are
designed to enable the controller of a <a>DID</a> to prove control over
it and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry, identity
provider, or certificate authority. <a>DIDs</a> are URLs that relate a
<a>DID subject</a> to a <a>DID document</a> allowing trustable interactions with
that subject. <a>DID documents</a> are simple documents describing how to use
that specific <a>DID</a>. Each <a>DID document</a> can express cryptographic
material, verification methods, or <a>service endpoints</a>, which provide a
set of mechanisms enabling a <a>DID controller</a> to prove control of the
<a>DID</a>. <a>Service endpoints</a> enable trusted interactions with the
<a>DID subject</a>.
    </p>
<p>
This document specifies a common data model, a URL format, and a set of
operations for <a>DIDs</a>, <a>DID documents</a>, and <a>DID methods</a>.
